              The equilibrium solutions for this logistic equation are <m>p = 0</m> and <m>p = 1</m>.

            <p permid="p">
              We know that the general solution to the logistic equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P), \ P(0) = P_0</m>
              is
              <me>
                P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}
              </me>.
              In the context of this problem,
              we know that <m>k = 0.2</m>, <m>N = 1</m>,
              and <m>p(0) = 0.1</m> and therefore the solution is
              <me>
                p(t) = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1-0.1}{0.1}\right) e^{-0.2t} + 1} = \frac{1}{9e^{-0.2t} + 1}

              We know that <m>p</m> is changing most rapidly when its derivative,

              is largest.
              Recalling the original differential equation, we know that

                p' = 0.2p(1-p)
              </me>
              which shows that <m>p'</m> is a quadratic function of <m>p</m>.
              That quadratic function has zeros at <m>p = 0</m> and <m>p = 1</m>,
              so the vertex of this concave down quadratic function lies at <m>p = \frac{1}{2}</m>,
              and at this value of <m>p</m> the rate of change of <m>p</m> is largest.
              Thus, we solve the equation
              <m>p(t) = 0.5</m> to find the time at which the population is increasing fastest.
              We see that

                9e^{-0.2t} + 1 = 2
              </me>
              and <m>e^{-0.2t} = 1/9</m>.
              It follows that <m>t = -5 \ln(1/9) \approx 10.986</m> days.

          <li permid="l_k">
            <p permid="p">
              Since <m>p(t)</m> tells us the percentage of people who've heard the rumor,
              we need to solve the equation <m>p(t) = 0.8</m>.
              Thus we have
              <me>
                0.8 = \frac{1}{9e^{-0.2t} + 1}
              </me>

              Let <m>y</m> be the per capita growth rate as a function of <m>b</m>.
              Using the given data in the problem statement,

              From the form of the given logistic equation,

              In this situation, the initial condition is <m>P(0) = 10</m>,
              and by removing <m>20</m><percent /> of the population per year,
              we subtract <m>0.2P</m> from the rate that defines the differential equation,
              thus finding

                \frac{dP}{dt} = 0.1P(10 - P) - 0.2P

              Expanding and rewriting the differential equation in (b),

              </me>.
              This, too, is a logistic equation,
              with carrying capacity <m>8000</m> fish.

              We can solve this logistic equation in the usual way (keeping in mind the initial condition <m>P(0) = 10</m>,
              and noting that the carrying capacity is <m>8</m>):
              <me>
                P(t) = \frac{8}{\frac{8-10}{10}e^{-0.1 \cdot 8 t}+1} = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}
              </me>
              After one year, the population of fish will thus be
              <me>
                P(1) \approx 8.7899
              </me>
              thousand fish.

          <li permid="l_t">
            <p permid="p">
              To be within 10<percent /> of the carrying capacity,
              we need <m>0.9(8) \le P(t) \le 1.1(8)</m>.
              Since the initial condition is larger than the carrying capacity,
              we want to know when <m>P(t) = 1.1(8) = 8.8</m>.
              Thus we solve the equation
              <me>
                8.8 = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}
              </me>,
              which implies <m>-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1 = 8/8.8 = 10/11</m>.
              Thus, <m>e^{-0.8t} = 5/11</m>,
              so <m>t = -1.2 \ln(5/11) \approx 0.9461</m> years.
