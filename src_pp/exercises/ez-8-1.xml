        Finding limits of convergent sequences can be a challenge.
        However, there is a useful tool we can adapt from our study of limits of continuous functions at infinity to use to find limits of sequences.
        We illustrate in this exercise with the example of the sequence
        <me>
          \frac{\ln(n)}{n}
        </me>.

              Calculate the first 10 terms of this sequence.
              Based on these calculations,

              Draw the graph of <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[0,10]</m> and then plot the entries of the sequence on the graph.

        We return to the example begun in <xref ref="PA-8-1">Preview Activity</xref>
        to see how to derive the formula for the amount of money in an account at a given time.
        We do this in a general setting.
        Suppose you invest <m>P</m> dollars
        (called the <em>principal</em>)
        in an account paying <m>r\%</m> interest compounded monthly.
        In the first month you will receive <m>\frac{r}{12}</m>
        (here <m>r</m> is in decimal form;
        e.g., if we have <m>8\%</m> interest,
        we write <m>\frac{0.08}{12}</m>)
        of the principal <m>P</m> in interest, so you earn
        <me>
          P\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)
        </me>
        dollars in interest.
        Assume that you reinvest all interest.
        Then at the end of the first month your account will contain the original principal <m>P</m> plus the interest,
        or a total of
        <me>
          P_1 = P + P\left(\frac{r}{12}\right) = P\left( 1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)

        Continuous data is the basis for analog information,
        like music stored on old cassette tapes or vinyl records.
        A digital signal like on a CD or MP3 file is obtained by sampling an analog signal at some regular time interval and storing that information.
        For example,
        the sampling rate of a compact disk is 44,100 samples per second.
        So a digital recording is only an approximation of the actual analog information.
        Digital information can be manipulated in many useful ways that allow for,
        among other things,
        noisy signals to be cleaned up and large collections of information to be compressed and stored in much smaller space.
        While we won't investigate these techniques in this chapter,
        this exercise is intended to give an idea of the importance of discrete (digital) techniques.

              Ineffective sampling can lead to several problems in reproducing the original signal.
              As an example,
              partition the interval <m>[0,10]</m> into 8 equal length subintervals and create a list of points
              (the <em>sample</em>)

              The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second.
              As the part (a) illustrates,
              sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal
              (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called <em>aliasing</em>).
              There is an elegant theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited,
              which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information.
              This theorem also provides the <em>lowest</em>
              rate at which a signal can be sampled
              (called the Nyquist rate)
              without such a loss of information.
              The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points.
              Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period.
              Identify the frequency of the function <m>f</m> and determine the number of partitions of the interval <m>[0,10]</m> that give us the Nyquist rate.
