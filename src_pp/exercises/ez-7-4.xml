              Carbon-14 naturally occurs in our environment; any
              living organism takes in Carbon-14 when it eats and breathes.
              Upon
              dying,
              however, the organism no longer takes in Carbon-14.

              Suppose that you find remnants of a pre-historic firepit.
              By
              analyzing the charred wood in the pit, you determine that the
              amount of Carbon-14 is only 30<percent /> of the amount in living trees.
              Estimate the age of the firepit.<fn>

              Separating the variables to solve the differential equation yields
              <me>
                \frac{1}{M} \, dM = k \, dt
              </me>
              so
              <me>
                \int \frac{1}{M} \, dM = \int k \, dt
              </me>.
              Integrating and solving for <m>M</m>,
              we find <m>\ln|M| = kt + C</m> and thus
              <m>M = e^{kt+C} = e^{kt}e^C = Ke^{kt}</m> for some constant <m>K</m>.
              Using the initial condition <m>M(0) = M_0</m>,
              it follows that <m>K = M_0</m>.
              Therefore, the mass at time <m>t</m> is given by

              If we let <m>5730</m> years pass from time <m>0</m>,
              the remaining mass of the radioactive sample will be <m>\frac{1}{2}M_0</m>.
              This allows us to find the value of <m>k</m> by setting <m>M(5730)</m> equal to
              <m>\frac{1}{2}M_0</m> and solving for <m>t</m>.
              Doing so, we have <m>\frac{1}{2}M_0 = M_0e^{5730k}</m>,
              and thus <m>\frac{1}{2} = e^{5730k}</m>.
              It follows that

                \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 5730k

              from which we find <m>k = \frac{1}{5730}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}</m>.
              Hence,
              <me>
                M(t) = M_0e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}t} \approx M_0e^{-0.000121t}

              Similar work to our recent efforts in (c) shows that <m>t = \frac{5730\ln(4)}{\ln(2)} \approx 11460</m> years.
              This number makes sense because it takes <m>5730</m> years for half of the sample to decay,
              then another <m>5730</m> years for half to decay again,
              for a total of <m>(2)(5730)</m> years for the substance to decay to one quarter of its original amount.

              so we need to solve <m>0.3M_0 = M_0e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}t}</m>.
              Doing so in the usual way,
              we find that <m>t = -\frac{5730\ln(0.3)}{\ln(2)} \approx 9952.8</m> years,
              so we estimate that the sample is about <m>9973</m> years old.

              Since height decreases at <m>20</m> inches per minute when the water is filled to a depth of <m>100</m> inches,
              this tells us that <m>\frac{dh}{dt}\vert_{h=100} = -20</m>.
              Applying this information to the differential equation,

              we first separate the variables and write

                \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \frac{dh}{dt} = -5

              On the left, using the substitution <m>u = \ln (P/3)</m>,
