              To find the equilibrium solutions,
              we first set <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 0</m>.
              Doing so, we find that
              <m>20y = \frac{y}{2+y}</m>,
              so <m>40y + 20y^2 = y</m>, or <m>39y + 20y^2 = 0</m>.

              Since a negative equilibrium solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem,
              the only equilibrium solution to study is <m>y = 0</m>.

              we see that <m>dy/dt</m> is always positive,
              and thus the population will grow away from <m>y = 0</m>,
              making this equilibrium unstable.
              And this makes sense:  the population of mice will grow without bound,
              because one cat is insufficient to keep up with a mice population growing at a rate of <m>20</m> times its size per year.

              Similar work as in (d) shows that the equilibrium solutions are <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y = 1</m>,
              and if we plot <m>dy/dt</m> versus <m>y</m>,

              Even in that circumstance,
              whether the cats can keep the number of mice from growing without bound will depend on the initial number of mice present.
