          The average velocity on <m>[0.5,1]</m> is the slope of the line joining the points <m>(0.5,s(0.5))</m> and <m>(1,s(1))</m>,
          which is <m>AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{1-1}{1-0.5} = 0</m>.
          On <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>, we similarly find
          <m>AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = \frac{3-1}{2.5-1.5} = 2</m>, and on <m>[0,5]</m>,
          we have <m>AV_{[0,5]} = \frac{5-0}{5-0} = 1</m>.

        <li permid="l_s">
          Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.
          If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number,
          that number represents the instantaneous velocity.
          For example,
          to estimate the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 2</m>,
          we might consider average velocities on <m>[2,3]</m>,
          <m>[2,2.5]</m>, and <m>[2,2.25]</m>.
        </li>

        <li permid="l_b">
          If we draw the line through <m>(2,2)</m> and <m>(2.1,s(2.1))</m>,
          it looks like the line's slope is approximately 2.5:
          if we go over one grid-width,
          we appear to go up about 2.5.
          The slope of this line is clearly greater than the slope of the line through
          <m>(1.5, s(1.5))</m> and <m>(2.5, s(2.5))</m>, which is 2.
          Hence the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 2</m> is greater than the average velocity on <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>.
