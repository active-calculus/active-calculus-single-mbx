      In each of the following questions,
      draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described,
      as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis.
      In addition,
      draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice,
      along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid.
      It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find.

            revolving the region <m>S</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis and taking slices perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis,

            after we revolve the region <m>S</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis,

            when we revolve the region <m>S</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis,
            slices perpendicular to the <m>y</m>-axis are disks.
            Here we see that each disk's radius is a function of <m>y</m> and the disks have thickness <m>\Delta y</m>,
            so we will need to integrate with respect to <m>y</m> and consider the radius function
            <m>r(y) = y^2</m> (which comes from solving
            <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m> for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.
            Note how this is different from the problem in part (b) because of the axis we rotate about and how this forces us to integrate in terms of <m>y</m>.
            A typical slice has volume

              V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (y^2)^2 \Delta y
