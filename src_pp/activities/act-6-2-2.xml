      In each of the following questions,
      draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described,
      as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis.
      In addition,
      draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice,
      along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid.
      It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find.

            Observe that horizontal slices with thickness
            <m>\Delta y</m> are all cylindrical disks,
            each with radius given by
            <m>r(y) = y^2</m> since they are given by the curve <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m>,
            which can be equivalently expressed as <m>x = y^2</m>.
            The volume of each slice is thus
            <me>
              V_{\text{slice}} = \pi r(y)^2 \Delta y = \pi y^4 \Delta y
            </me>.
            The volume of the solid is thus given by the definite integral
            <me>
              V = \int_0^2 \pi y^4 \Delta \, dy
            </me>.

            Slicing perpendicular to the axis of rotation,
            we get slices of thickness
            <m>\Delta y</m> that are shaped like washers.
            The outer radius, <m>R(y)</m>,
            is given by <m>R(y) = 4</m>;
            the innner radius is given by the function <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m>,
            but expressed with <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>,
            so <m>r(y) = y^2</m>.
            It follows that a representative washer slice has volume
            <me>
              V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi (16 - y^4) \Delta y
            </me>.
            Further,
            since <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m> and <m>x = 4</m> intersect at the point <m>(4,2)</m>,
            we integrate from <m>y = 0</m> to <m>y = 2</m> and thus find that the total volume is

              V = \int_0^2 \pi (16 - y^4) \, dy

            The curves <m>y=x^3</m> and <m>y=2x</m> intersect where <m>x^3 = 2x</m>,
            so where <m>x^3-2x = x(x^2 - 2) = 0</m>.
            The two nonnegative values of <m>x</m> that make this equation true are <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=\sqrt{2}</m>,
            and thus the points <m>(0,0)</m> and
            <m>(\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})</m> form the boundaries of the region <m>S</m> that is being rotated about the <m>x</m>-axis.
            Since we rotate about the horizontal axis,
            we slice perpendicular to that axis with slices of thickness <m>\Delta x</m>.
            A representative slice is in the shape of a washer and has volume
            <me>
              V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(x)^2 - r(x)^2) \Delta x = \pi ( (2x)^2 - (x^3)^2 ) \Delta x

            and thus the total volume of the solid is

            To use the same region <m>S</m> as in part (c),

            we shift to horizontal slices of thickness <m>\Delta y</m>,
            and thus need to express the curves as functions of <m>y</m>:
            the rightmost curve is <m>x = R(y) = \sqrt[3]{y}</m>,
            while the leftmost curve is <m>x = r(y) = \frac{1}{2}y</m>.
            A representative slice is a washer whose volume is

            For this pair of curves,
            we see they intersect where
            <m>x=(y-1)^2</m> and <m>x = (y+1)</m> are both true,
            and hence where <m>(y-1)^2 = y+1</m>.
            Expanding, moving all terms to the left,
            and combining like terms,
            we see that <m>y^2 - 2y + 1 = y + 1</m>, so
            <m>y^2 - 3y = 0</m>.
            It follows that <m>y(y-3) = 0</m> and therefore <m>y=3</m> or <m>y = 0</m>.
            Plotting the region and revolving about the <m>y</m>-axis,
            we see that horizontal slices of thickness
            <m>\Delta y</m> are shaped like washers.
            The outer radius is given by <m>R(y) = y+1</m>,
            while the inner radius is <m>r(y) = (y-1)^2</m>.
            A representative slice thus has volume

              V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi( (y+1)^2 - ((y-1)^2)^2 ) \Delta y
            </me>.
            The volume of the solid of revolution is therefore
            <me>
              V = \int_0^3 \pi( (y+1)^2 - (y-1)^4 ) \, dy
