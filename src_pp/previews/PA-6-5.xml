    A company with a large customer base has a call center that receives thousands of calls a day.
    After studying the data that represents how long callers wait for assistance,
    they find that the function
    <m>p(t) = 0.25e^{-0.25t}</m> models the time customers wait in the following way:
    the fraction of customers who wait between <m>t = a</m> and <m>t = b</m> minutes is given by
    <me>
      \int_a^b p(t) \, dt
    </me>.

  <p permid="p2">
    Use this information to answer the following questions.
