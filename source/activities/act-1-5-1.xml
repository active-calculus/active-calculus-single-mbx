        <p>
            Over each subsequent time interval,
            we see that the amount of increase in the potato's temperature gets less and less,
            thus we expect the value of <m>F'(t)</m> to get smaller and smaller as time goes on.

      <answer>
        <p>
            The value <m>F(64) = 330.28</m> is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 64,
            while <m>F'(64) = 1.341</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant <m>t = 64</m>,
            and its units are degrees per minute.
            Because at time <m>t = 64</m> the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute,
            we expect that at <m>t = 65</m>,
            the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at <m>t = 64</m>,
            or in other words <m>F(65) \approx 330.28 + 1.341 = 331.621</m>.
            Similarly, at <m>t = 66</m>,
            two minutes have elapsed from <m>t = 64</m>,
            so we expect an increase of <m>2 \cdot 1.341</m> degrees:
            <m>F(66) \approx 330.28 + 2 \cdot 1.341 = 332.962</m>.

            Throughout the time interval <m>[0,90]</m>,
            the temperature <m>F</m> of the potato is increasing.
            But as time goes on,
            the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing.
            That is,
            while the values of <m>F</m> continue to get larger as time progresses,
            the values of <m>F'</m> are getting smaller
            (while still remaining positive).
