      Suppose it is known that for a given differentiable function <m>y = g(x)</m>,
      its local linearization at the point where <m>a = -1</m> is given by <m>L(x) = -2 + 3(x+1)</m>.

            Using the formula for <m>L</m>,
            <m>L(-1) = -2</m>; Since

            Recall that the form of the local linearization is <m>L(x) = g(a) + g'(a)(x-a)</m>.

            Since <m>L(x) = g(-1) + g'(-1)(x+1) = -2 + 3(x+1)</m>,

            Alternatively,
            we could observe that the value and slope of <m>g</m> must match the value and slope of <m>L</m> at the point of tangency.

            Less.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Because <m>g'(-1) = 3</m>,
            we see that <m>g'</m> is increasing near <m>a = -1</m>, and therefore <m>g(-1.03)</m> is expected to be less than <m>g(-1)</m>.

            The illustration below shows a possible graph of <m>y = g(x)</m> near <m>x = -1</m>,

            In the figure below,
            we use the results of our previous work to generate the plot shown,
            which is a possible graph of <m>y = g(x)</m> near <m>x = -1</m>,
