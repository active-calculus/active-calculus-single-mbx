      Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity <m>v</m>
      (in meters per second)
      at time <m>t</m>
      (in seconds)
      given by the piecewise linear function whose graph is pictured at left in <xref ref="F-4-1-Act3">Figure</xref>.
      We view movement to the right as being in the positive direction
      (with positive velocity),
      while movement to the left is in the negative direction.

            By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between

            (each of which is <m>1</m>),
            it follows that the object's total distance traveled is <m>2</m>,
            while its change in position is <m>0</m>.
            The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by <m>v</m> on <m>[0,2]</m> is <m>1 - 1 = 0</m>.  Finally, the object's position at <m>t = 2</m> is <m>s(2) = 1</m></p>

            The object's position is increasing wherever its velocity is positive,

            What is the object's position at <m>t = 8</m>?
            How many total meters has it traveled to get to this point (including distance in both directions)?

        <answer>
          <p><m> s(8) - s(0) = 5 \ \mbox{m} </m>, while the distance traveled on
            <m>[0,8]</m> is <m>D = 13</m>, and thus these two quantities are different.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            By calculating the area bounded by the curve,
            we find 1 unit of area on <m>[0,1]</m>, 4 units of area on <m>[1,4]</m>,
            and 8 units of area on <m>[4,8]</m>,
            thus the total distance traveled on
            <m>0 \le t \le 8</m> is <m>D = 1 + 4 + 8</m> meters.
            As the change in position is given by the net signed area on this interval,
            we find that the change in position is
            <me>
              s(8) - s(0) = 1 - 4 + 8 = 5 \ \mbox{m}
            </me>.   We thus observe that the distance traveled and change in position on <m>[0,8]</m>
            are different.

            Consider finding the area bounded by
            <m>y = v(t)</m> and the <m>t</m>-axis on each interval <m>[0,1]</m>,

            See the figure below.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            In the figure below,
            at left we list all of the areas bounded by <m>v</m> on each one-unit subinterval.
            Along with the given starting point that <m>s(0) = 1</m>,
            we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function <m>s</m>.
            For instance,
            we know <m>s(1) - s(0) = 1</m>, hence <m>s(1) = 2</m>.
            Similarly, <m>s(2) - s(1) = -1</m>, thus <m>s(2) = 1</m>.
            Continuing across the interval,
            we generate the function <m>s</m> that is pictured at right.
            Note that the portion of <m>s</m> from <m>t = 2</m> to <m>t = 3</m> is linear because <m>v</m> is constant there,
            while the other parts of <m>s</m> appear to be quadratic,
            as they correspond to intervals where <m>v</m> is linear.
