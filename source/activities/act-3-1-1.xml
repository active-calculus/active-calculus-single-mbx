      <introduction>
        <p>
      Suppose that <m>g(x)</m> is a function continuous for every value of <m>x \ne 2</m> whose first derivative is <m>g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}</m>.
      Further, assume that it is known that <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m>.

            Determine all critical numbers of <m>g</m>.

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            For which <m>x</m> is <m>g'(x) = 0</m>?

          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since <m>g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}</m>,
            we see that <m>g'(x) = 0</m> implies that <m>x = -4</m> or <m>x = 1</m>.
            While <m>x = 2</m> makes <m>g'</m> undefined,
            we are told that <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m>,
            so <m>x = 2</m> is not in the domain of <m>g</m>,
            and hence is technically not a critical number of <m>g</m>.
            Nonetheless,
            we place <m>x = 2</m> on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which <m>g'</m> may change sign.

            By developing a carefully labeled first derivative sign chart,
            decide whether <m>g</m> has as a local maximum,

          <p><m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m> and neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The first derivative sign chart shows that <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \lt -4</m>,
            <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>-4 \lt x \lt 1</m>,
            <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>1 \lt x \lt 2</m>,
            and <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \gt 2</m>.
            By the first derivative test,
            <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m> and neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>.
            As these are the only two critical numbers,
            these are the only two locations for possible extremes.
            (Note:
            although <m>g</m> changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x = 2</m>,
            this is due to a vertical asymptote,
            and <m>g</m> does not have a minimum there.)

            Justify your claims.

        <answer>
          <p><m>g</m> does not have a global minimum;
            it is unclear
            (at this point in our work)
            if <m>g</m> increases without bound,
            so we can't say for certain whether or not <m>g</m> has a global maximum.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Because <m>g</m> is decreasing as <m>x \to 2^-</m>
            (where <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote),
            <m>g</m> does not have a global minimum.
            For <m>x \gt 2</m>, <m>g</m> is always increasing,
            which suggests that <m>g</m> does not have a global maximum
            (though we do not know for sure that <m>g</m> increases without bound).

            We observe that

            Since <m>g'(x) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
            this tells us that <m>g</m> increases without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            From all of our work above,
            we know that <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m>,
            a horizontal tangent line with neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>,
            and a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m>,
            plus <m>g</m> and <m>g'</m> both increase without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
            Thus, a possible graph of <m>g</m> is the following.
