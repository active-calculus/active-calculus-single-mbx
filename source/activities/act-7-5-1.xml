            Equilibrium solutions occur where

            This means that if you have $200000 in the account,
            then the amount of money in the account will remain constant at $200000.

            Suppose we initially have $100000 in the account.
            We will solve the intitial value problem
            <me permid="VvJ">
              \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A - 10000,   A(0) = 100000
            </me>.
            Using separation of variables, we find that
            <me permid="BCS">
              A = 200000 + C e^{t/20}
            </me>,
            and since <m>A(0) = 100000</m>, we have
            <me permid="hKb">
              A = 200000 - 100000e^{t/20}
            </me>.
            To determine when the account will be depleted,
            we solve the equation <m>A = 0</m> for <m>t</m>.
            Since <m>200000 - 100000 e^{t/20} = 0</m>,
            it follows <m>e^{t/20} = 2</m> and thus <m>t = 20 \ln(2)</m>,
            so the account will be depleted in about 13.86 years.

        <li permid="lKa">
          <p permid="Exy">
            You must have at least $200000 in the account to make sure the account will never be depleted.

            Now suppose the intitial deposit is $300000 and we want to what amount <m>w</m> we can withdraw every year without depleting the account.
            So the initial value problem is
            <me permid="NRk">
              \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A - w, A(0) = 300000
            </me>.
            The solution to this initial value problem is
            <me permid="tYt">
              A = 20w + (300000 - 20w) e^{t/20}
            </me>.
            To make sure the account is never depleted,
            we need <m>(300000 - 20W)</m> to be greater than or equal to 0.
            Solving the inequality <m>300000 - 2w \geq 0</m>,
            we obtain <m>w \leq 15000</m>.
            We can withdraw up to $15000 every year and the account will not be depleted.
