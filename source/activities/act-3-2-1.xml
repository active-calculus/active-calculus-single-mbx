      <p>
      Consider the family of functions defined by <m>p(x) = x^3 - ax</m>,
      where <m>a \ne 0</m> is an arbitrary constant.

            Find <m>p'(x)</m> and determine the critical numbers of <m>p</m>.
            How many critical numbers does <m>p</m> have?
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
            When solving <m>p'(x) = 0</m>,
            think about two possible cases:
            when <m>a\gt 0</m> and when <m>a \lt 0</m>.
          </p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p><m>p</m> has two critical numbers (<m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>) whenever <m>a \gt 0</m> and no critical numbers when <m>a \lt 0</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            We first note that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m>,
            so to find critical numbers we set
            <m>p'(x) = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
            This leads to the equation <m>3x^2 - a = 0</m>,
            which implies
            <me>
              x^2 = \frac{a}{3}
            </me>.
            If <m>a \gt 0</m>,
            then the solutions to this equation are <m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>;
            if <m>a \lt  0</m>, then the equation has no solution.
            Hence,
            <m>p</m> has two critical numbers (<m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>) whenever <m>a \gt 0</m> and no critical numbers when <m>a \lt  0</m>.

            Construct a first derivative sign chart for <m>p</m>.
            What can you say about the overall behavior of <m>p</m> if the constant <m>a</m> is positive?
            Why?
            What if the constant <m>a</m> is negative?

            Remember that any quadratic function can be zero at most two times.
            How does the graph of <m>y = 3x^2 - a</m> look?
          </p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>
            When <m>a \lt 0</m>,
            <m>p</m> is always increasing and has no relative extreme values.
            When <m>a\gt 0</m>, <m>p</m> has a relative maximum at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and a relative minimum at <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            For the case when <m>a \lt 0</m>,
            we observe that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> is positive for every value of <m>x</m>,
            and thus <m>p</m> is always increasing and has no relative extreme values.
            (There are no critical numbers to place on the first derivative sign chart,
            and <m>p'</m> is always positive.)
            For the case when <m>a\gt 0</m>,
            we observe that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> is a concave up parabola with zeros at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.
            It follows that for <m>x \lt -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m>
            (so <m>p</m> is increasing);
            for <m>-\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}} \lt x \lt \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m> (so <m>p</m> is decreasing);
            and for <m>x\gt \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m>
            (so <m>p</m> is again increasing).
            In this situation, we see that <m>p</m> has a relative maximum at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and a relative minimum at <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.

        <p><m>p</m> is CCD for <m>x \lt 0</m> and <m>p</m> is CCU for <m>x\gt 0</m>,
            making <m>x = 0</m> an inflection point.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Since <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> and <m>a</m> is constant,
            it follows that <m>p''(x) = 6x</m>.
            Note that <m>p''(x) = 0</m> when <m>x = 0</m> and that
            <m>p''(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x \lt 0</m> and <m>p''(x)\gt 0</m> for <m>x\gt 0</m>.
            Hence <m>p</m> is CCD for <m>x \lt 0</m> and <m>p</m> is CCU for <m>x\gt 0</m>,
            making <m>x = 0</m> an inflection point.

        <p>
            Below, we show the two possible situations.
            At left,
            for the case when <m>a \lt 0</m> and <m>p</m> is always increasing with an inflection point at <m>x = 0</m>,
            and at right for when <m>a\gt 0</m> and <m>p</m> has a relative maximum at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and a relative minimum at <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            again with an inflection point at <m>x = 0</m>.
            Note, too,
            that <m>p</m> has its <m>x</m>-intercepts at <m>x = \pm \sqrt{a}</m>.
