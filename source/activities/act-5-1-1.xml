      Suppose that the function
      <m>y = f(x)</m> is given by the graph shown in <xref ref="F-5-1-Act1">Figure</xref>,
      and that the pieces of <m>f</m> are either portions of lines or portions of circles.
      In addition,
      let <m>F</m> be an antiderivative of <m>f</m> and say that <m>F(0) = -1</m>.
      Finally, assume that for <m>x \le 0</m> and <m>x \ge 7</m>,
      <m>f(x) = 0</m>.

            A relative maximum for <m>F</m> will occur wherever <m>F'</m> changes from positive to negative,

            and <m>F(-1) = -1</m>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Recall that <m>F(1) = F(0) + \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt</m>,
            so <m>F(1) = -1 + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}</m>.
            Similarly,
            <m>F(2) = F(0) + \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt = -1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2}</m>.
            Continuing these calculations,
            <m>F(3) = \frac{\pi}{4} - 1</m>,
            <m>F(4) = \frac{\pi}{4}-2</m>,
            <m>F(5) = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{5}{2}</m>,
            <m>F(6) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{5}{2}</m>,
            <m>F(7) = \frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{5}{2}</m>.
            Furthermore,
            since <m>f(t) = 0</m> for all <m>t \lt 0</m> and all <m>t \gt 7</m>,
            it follows <m>F(8) = \frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{5}{2}</m> and <m>F(-1) = -1</m>.

            What happens if we change one key piece of information:
            in particular,
            say that <m>G</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m> and <m>G(0) = 0</m>.
            How (if at all) would your answers to the preceding questions change?
            Sketch a graph of <m>G</m> on the same axes as the graph of <m>F</m> you constructed in (e).

            this changes each response in by 1:
