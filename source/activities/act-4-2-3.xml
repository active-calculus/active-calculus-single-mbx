      Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity <m>v</m>

            Compute <m>M_5</m>, the middle Riemann sum,

        <p>
            For this Riemann sum with five subintervals,
            <m>\Delta t = \frac{5-1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}</m>,
            so <m>t_0 = 1</m>, <m>t_1 = 1.8</m>, <m>t_2 = 2.6</m>,
            <m>t_3 = 3.4</m>, <m>t_4 = 4.2</m> and <m>t_5 = 4</m>.
            It follows that

            Building on your work in (a),
            estimate the total change in position of the object on the interval <m>[1,5]</m>.

      <hint>
        <p>
            Change in position is tied to the net signed area bounded by the velocity function.

      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>
            The change in position is approximately <m>-1.44</m> feet.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Since the net signed area bounded by <m>v</m> on <m>[1,5]</m> represents the total change in position of the object on the interval <m>[1,5]</m>,
            it follows that <m>M_5</m> estimates the total change in position.
            Hence,
            the change in position is approximately <m>-1.44</m> feet.

            Think about how total distance is different from change in position when the velocity is sometimes negative.

      <solution>
        <p>
            To estimate the total distance traveled by the object on <m>[1,5]</m>,
            we have to calculate the total area between the curve and the <m>t</m>-axis.
            Thus,
            <me>
              D \approx \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 1 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} +  \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{292}{125} \approx 2.336

            Use appropriate computing technology<fn>
            For instance,
            consider the <url href="https://gvsu.edu/s/a9" visual="gvsu.edu/s/a9">applet</url>
            and change the function and adjust the locations of the blue points that represent the interval endpoints <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

            Besides the noted applet,

        <p><m>-\frac{4}{3}</m> is the object's total change in position on <m>[1,5]</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Using appropriate technology,
            <m>M_{10} = -1.36</m> and <m>M_{20} = -1.34</m>.
            Further calculations suggest that
            <m>M_n \to -\frac{4}{3} = -1.\overline{33}</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>,
            and this number represents the object's total change in position on <m>[1,5]</m>.
