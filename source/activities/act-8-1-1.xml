            Let <m>s_n</m> be the <m>n</m>th term in the sequence <m>1, 2, 3, \ldots</m>.

            Find a formula for <m>s_n</m> and use appropriate technological tools to draw a graph of entries in this sequence by plotting points of the form <m>(n,s_n)</m> for some values of <m>n</m>.
            Most graphing calculators can plot sequences;
            directions follow for the TI-84.

                  In the <c>MODE</c> menu,
                  highlight <c>SEQ</c> in the <c>FUNC</c> line and press <c>ENTER</c>.

                  In the <c>Y=</c> menu,
                  you will now see lines to enter sequences.
                  Enter a value for <c>nMin</c>
                  (where the sequence starts),
                  a function for <c>u(n)</c>
                  (the <m>n</m>th term in the sequence),
                  and the value of <c>u(nMin)</c>.
                </p></li><li><p>
                  Set your window coordinates (this involves choosing limits for <m>n</m> as well as the window coordinates <c>XMin</c>,
            <c>XMax</c>, <c>YMin</c>, and <c>YMax</c>).
                </p></li><li><p>
                  The <c>GRAPH</c> key will draw a plot of your sequence.
                </p></li></ul>

            Using your knowledge of limits of continuous functions as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
            decide if this sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> has a limit as <m>n \to \infty</m>.

            By observation we see that a formula for <m>s_n</m> is <m>s_n = n</m>.

            We recalling that a function <m>f</m> has a limit <m>L</m> at infinity if we can make the values of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we want by choosing <m>x</m> as large as we need.
            Since we can make the values of <m>n</m> in our sequence as large as we want by choosing <m>n</m> to be as large as we need,
            we suspect that this sequence does not have a limit as <m>n</m> goes to infinity.

          <p>
            Since the numerator is always 1 more than the denominator,
            a formula for <m>s_n</m> is <m>s_n = \frac{n+1}{n}</m>.
