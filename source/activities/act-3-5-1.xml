        <p>
      A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone
      (point down)
      with a base of radius 6 feet and a depth of 8 feet.
      Suppose that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant instantaneous rate of 4 cubic feet per minute.

            Draw a picture of the conical tank,

            Introduce variables that measure the radius of the water's surface and the water's depth in the tank,

            Letting <m>r</m> represent the water's radius at time <m>t</m> and <m>h</m> the water's depth,

            Since the water in the tank always takes the shape of a circular cone,
            the volume of water in the tank at time <m>t</m> is given by <m>V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h</m>.
            Because we have established that <m>r = \frac{3}{4}h</m>,
            it follows that
            <me>
              V = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{3}{4}h \right)^2 h = \frac{3}{16} \pi h^3

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            It is given in the problem setting that water is entering the tank at a rate of 4 cubic feet per minute,
            hence <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 4</m>,
            and we are interested in the rate of change of the water's depth when <m>h = 3</m>.
            Substituting these values into the equation that relates
            <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>, we find that
            <me>
              4 =  \frac{9}{16} \pi 3^2 \left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3}
            </me>,
            so that <m>\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3} = \frac{64}{81\pi} \approx 0.2515</m> feet per minute.

            Most rapidly when <m>h = 3</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Having established that 
            <me>
              \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{9}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
            </me>,
            using <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 4</m> and solving for <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>, we have 
            <me>
              \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{4}{\frac{9}{16} \pi h^2}
            </me>.
            This relationship between <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> and <m>h</m> shows that as <m>h</m> increases, <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> decreases.  Thus, the water (which enters the tank at a constant rate) is rising most rapidly when <m>h = 3</m>, and this matches our intuition for how the water should rise in the conical tank:  quickly at first, and then ever more slowly as time progresses.
