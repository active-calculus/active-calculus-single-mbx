      <introduction>
        <p>
      In each of the following questions,
      draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described,
      as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis.
      In addition,
      draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice,
      along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid.
      It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find.
      For each prompt,
      use the finite region <m>S</m> in the first quadrant bounded by the curves <m>y = 2x</m> and <m>y = x^3</m>.

            The two curves intersect in the first quadrant at <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})</m>.
            Revolving the region <m>S</m> about the line <m>y = -2</m>,
            we see that a typical slice is a washer with thickness <m>\Delta x</m>,
            outer radius <m>R(x) = 2x + 2</m>,
            and inner radius <m>r(x) = x^3 + 2</m>.
            It follows by the washer method that

            In this situation, revolving about <m>y = 4</m>,
            we see that the outer radius of a typical washer is <m>R(x) = 4 - x^3</m>,
            while the inner radius is

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Because we are revolving about <m>x = -1</m>,
            when we slice perpendicular to this we get washers of thickness <m>\Delta y</m>,
            and thus we need to write the two curves as functions of <m>y</m> in order to determine the radii of the slices as functions of <m>y</m>,
            we note that the line can be expressed as
            <m>x = \frac{1}{2}y</m> and the cubic curve can be rewritten in the form <m>x = y^{1/3}</m>.
            The outer radius of a typical slice is thus
            <m>R(y) = y^{1/3} + 1</m> and the inner radius is <m>r(y) = \frac{1}{2}y + 1</m>.
            It follows that the volume of the solid is
            <me>
              V = \int_{0}^{2\sqrt{2}} \pi( (y^{1/3} + 1)^2 - (\frac{1}{2}y + 1)^2 ) \, dy = \frac{2}{15}(15 + 8\sqrt{2}) \pi \approx 11.022

          <p>
            Here, the outer radius is
            <m>R(y) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}y</m> and the inner radius is <m>r(y) = 5 - y^{1/3}</m>,
            so the total volume of the solid is
