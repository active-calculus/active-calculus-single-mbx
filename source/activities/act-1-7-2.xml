            but <m>f(3)</m> is not defined,
            so the limit exists but does not equal the function value.

            or if the limit exists but does not equal the function value,
            then <m>f</m> is not continuous at the point.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Based on our work in (a), (b), and (c),
            <m>f</m> is not continuous at <m>a=-2</m> and <m>a = 2</m> because <m>f</m> does not have a limit at those points;
            <m>f</m> is not continuous at <m>a = 3</m> since <m>f</m> is not defined there;
            and <m>f</m> is not continuous at <m>a = -1</m> because at that point its limit does not equal its function value.
          </p>

            Which condition is stronger,
            and hence implies the other:
            <m>f</m> has a limit at <m>x = a</m> or <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x = a</m>?
            Explain, and hence complete the following sentence:
            <q>If <m>f</m><fillin/> at <m>x = a</m>,
            then <m>f</m><fillin/> at <m>x = a</m>,</q>
            where you complete the blanks with <em>has a limit</em>
            and <em>is continuous</em>, using each phrase once.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Note that the definition of being continuous requires the limit to exist.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <q>If <m>f</m><em>is continuous</em> at <m>x = a</m>,
            then <m>f</m><em>has a limit</em> at <m>x = a</m>.</q>
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p><q>If <m>f</m><em>is continuous</em> at <m>x = a</m>,
            then <m>f</m><em>has a limit</em> at <m>x = a</m>,</q>
            since one of the defining properties of
            <q>being continuous</q>
            at <m>x = a</m> is that the function has a limit at that input value.
            This shows that being continuous is a stronger condition than having a limit.
