      <p>
      As pictured in the <url href="https://gvsu.edu/s/9q" visual="gvsu.edu/s/9q">applet</url>,
      a skateboarder who is 6 feet tall rides under a 15 foot tall lamppost at a constant rate of 3 feet per second.
      We are interested in understanding how fast his shadow is changing at various points in time.

      </p>

    <task workspace="3cm" xml:id="act-3-5-3-task-0">
      <statement>
        <p>
            Draw an appropriate right triangle that represents a snapshot in time of the skateboarder,
            lamppost,
            and his shadow.
            Let <m>x</m> denote the horizontal distance from the base of the lamppost to the skateboarder and <m>s</m> represent the length of his shadow.
            Label these quantities,
            as well as the skateboarder's height and the lamppost's height on the diagram.
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
            Note that the lengths of the legs of the right triangle will be <m>15</m> for the vertical one and <m>x + s</m> for the horizontal one.

            The given information leads us to construct the following diagram:

      <statement>
        <p>
            Observe that the skateboarder and the lamppost represent parallel line segments in the diagram,
            and thus similar triangles are present.
            Use similar triangles to establish an equation that relates <m>x</m> and <m>s</m>.
          </p>
      </statement>

        <p>
            The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow,
            with legs <m>6</m> and <m>s</m> is similar to the large triangle that has the lamppost as one of its legs.

        <p><m>3s = 2x</m>.

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            The small triangle formed by the skateboarder and his shadow,
            with legs of length <m>6</m> and <m>s</m> is similar to the large triangle that has the lamppost as one of its legs (length 15) and horizontal leg of length <m>x + s</m>.
            Because the ratios of the lengths of the legs of these two triangles is equal, we have
            <me>
              \frac{s}{6} = \frac{s+x}{15}
            </me>.
            Simplifying, we have <m>15s = 6s + 6x</m>,
            so that <m>9s = 2x</m>,
            or most simply, <m>3s = 2x</m>.

            Use your work in (b) to find an equation that relates

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Differentiating with respect to <m>t</m>,
            it is immediate that <m>3 \frac{ds}{dt} = 2\frac{dx}{dt}</m>.

            At what rate is the length of the skateboarder's shadow increasing at the instant the skateboarder is 8 feet from the lamppost?

            Find <m>\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x=8}</m>.

      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p><m>\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x=8} = 2</m> feet per second.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Since <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{dx}{dt}</m>,
            and <m>\frac{dx}{dt} = 3</m>,
            it follows <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = 2</m> for every value of <m>t</m>
            (and <m>x</m>).
            Thus,
            <m>\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x=8} = 2</m> feet per second.

            As the skateboarder's distance from the lamppost increases,
            is his shadow's length increasing at an increasing rate,
            increasing at a decreasing rate,
            or increasing at a constant rate?

            at a constant rate.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Because <m>\frac{ds}{dt}</m> is constant,
            the shadow's length is increasing at a constant rate
            (irrespective of the distance from the skateboarder to the lamppost).

            Which is moving more rapidly:
            the skateboarder or the tip of his shadow?
            Explain, and justify your answer.

      <hint>
        <p>
            Let <m>y</m> represent the location of the tip of the shadow,
            so that <m>y = x + s</m>.

      <answer>
        <p>
            Let <m>y</m> represent the location of the tip of the shadow;
            <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 5</m> feet/sec.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Let <m>y</m> represent the location of the tip of the shadow,
            so that <m>y = x + s</m>.
            Observe that we can now compute <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m> in terms of
            <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{ds}{dt}</m>,
            with <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 3 + 2 = 5</m> feet/sec,
            and hence the tip of the shadow is moving more rapidly than the skateboarder himself.
