            Simpson's Rule gives the best estimate for a function of consistent concavity.

      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>
            Simpson's rule gives the best approximation of the distance traveled,
            <m>\int_0^{1.8} v(t) dt \approx 140.8 \text{ ft}</m>, which leads to <m>AV_{[0,1.8]} \approx \frac{140.8}{1.8} \approx 78.22 \text{ ft/sec}</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Simpson's rule gives the best approximation of the distance traveled since it is a weighted average of the midpoint and trapezoid rules and uses more information about the velocity than the other methods.
            The units on each of the estimates,
            including Simpson's Rule,
            are "feet", since ft/sec <m>\cdot</m> sec = ft.
            Thus,
            the best approximation we have generated for distance traveled is <m>\int_0^{1.8} v(t) dt \approx 140.8 \text{ ft }</m>.
          </p>
        <p>
            To estimate the average velocity on <m>[0,1.8]</m>, we compute change in position divided by change in time.  Here, since <m>v(t)</m> is always positive, the car's change in position equals its distance traveled.  Hence,
            <me>
              AV_{[0,1.8]} = \frac{s(1.8)-s(0)}{1.8-0} \approx \frac{140.8}{1.8} = \frac{740}{9} \approx 78.22 \text{ ft/sec}
            </me>.
