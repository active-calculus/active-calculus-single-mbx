            The object moved <m>2 \pi</m> meters in 4 minutes.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Because the velocity <m>v(t)</m> is always nonnegative in this problem,
            the meaning of <m>\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt = 2\pi</m> is both the distance traveled and the change in position of the object on the interval <m>0 \le t \le \pi</m>.
            Specifically, the object moved <m>2 \pi</m> meters in 4 minutes.

            Constructing a figure similar to those shown in this section on the topic of average value of a function,
            we find the following,
            which demonstrates a rectangle having the same area as the semicircle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The height of the rectangle is the average value of <m>v</m>,

            How can you use the average value you found in (d) to compute the total distance traveled by the moving object over <m>[0,4]</m>?

            Distance equals average rate times <m>\ldots</m>.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m> D = 2\pi</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Knowing that average velocity is <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
            it follows from the fact that distance traveled equals average rate times time
            (provided velocity is always nonnegative),
            we have
            <me>
              D = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 4 = 2\pi
            </me>.
            We see from (c) or (f) that we are simply considering the situation from two different perspectives:
            if we know the distance traveled,
            we can find average velocity,
            or if we know average velocity,
            we can find distance traveled.
