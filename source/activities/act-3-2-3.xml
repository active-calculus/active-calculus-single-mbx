        <p>
      Let <m>L(t) = \frac{A}{1+ce^{-kt}}</m>, where <m>A</m>,
      <m>c</m>, and <m>k</m> are all positive real numbers.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Observe that we can equivalently write <m>L(t) = A(1+ce^{-kt})^{-1}</m>.
            Find <m>L'(t)</m> and explain why <m>L</m> has no critical numbers.
            Is <m>L</m> always increasing or always decreasing?
            Why?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Use the chain rule, treating <m>A</m>,
            <m>c</m>, and <m>k</m> as constants.

        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m>L</m> is an always increasing function.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            By the chain rule and treating <m>A</m>, <m>c</m>,
            and <m>k</m> as constants, we find that
            <me>
              L'(t) = A(-1)(1+ce^{-kt})^{-2} ce^{-kt}(-k) = Acke^{-kt}(1+ce^{-kt})^{-2}
            </me>.
            Since <m>A</m>, <m>c</m>,
            and <m>k</m> are all positive and
            <m>e^{-kt} \gt 0</m> for all values of <m>t</m>,
            it is apparent that <m>L'(t)</m> is never zero,
            and indeed is positive for every value of <m>t</m>.
            Thus, <m>L</m> is an always increasing function.

          <p>
            Given the fact that

              L''(t) = Ack^2e^{-kt} \frac{ce^{-kt}-1}{(1+ce^{-kt})^3}

            find all values of <m>t</m> such that

            For which values of <m>t</m> is a function in this family concave up?  concave down?

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Note that the only way
            <m>L''(t) = 0</m> is if <m>ce^{-kt}-1 = 0</m>.

        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m>L</m> is concave up for all
            <m>t \lt -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)</m> and concave up for all other values of <m>t</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Given that
            <me>
              L''(t) = Ack^2e^{-kt} \frac{ce^{-kt}-1}{(1+ce^{-kt})^3}
            </me>,
            the only way <m>L''(t) = 0</m> is if <m>ce^{-kt}-1 = 0</m>.
            Solving <m>ce^{-kt}-1 = 0</m> for <m>t</m>,
            we first write <m>e^{-kt} = \frac{1}{c}</m>.
            Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,
            <m>-kt = \ln(\frac{1}{c})</m>, so that
            <me>
              t = -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)
            </me>
            is the only value of <m>t</m> for which <m>L''(t) = 0</m>.
            Now, observe that since
            <m>ce^{-kt} \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
            the quantity <m>ce^{-kt} - 1</m> will be positive to the left of where it is zero and negative to the right of where it is zero.
            Since this is the only term in <m>L''(t)</m> that can change sign,
            it follows that <m>L''(t) \gt 0</m> for <m>t \lt  -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)</m> and
            <m>L''(t) \gt 0</m> for <m>t \gt -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)</m>,
            making <m>L</m> concave up to the left of the noted inflection point and concave down thereafter.

              \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{A}{1+ce^{-kt}} = 0

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Recalling that <m>e^{-kt} \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
            we observe that
            <me>
              \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{A}{1+ce^{-kt}} = \frac{A}{1+0} = A
            </me>,
            so <m>L</m> has a horizontal asymptote of <m>y = A</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>.
            On the other hand,
            since <m>e^{-kt} \to \infty</m> as <m>t \to -\infty</m>,
            this causes the denominator of <m>L</m> to grow without bound
            (while the numerator remains constant),
            and therefore
            <me>
              \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{A}{1+ce^{-kt}} = 0
            </me>,
            which means <m>L</m> has a horizontal asymptote of <m>y = 0</m> as <m>t \to -\infty</m>.

            The inflection point on the graph of <m>L</m> is <m>( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right), \frac{A}{2})</m>.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            From (b), we know that
            <m>t = -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)</m> is the location of the inflection point of <m>L</m>.
            Evaluating the function at this point, we find that

              L\left( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right) \right) = \frac{A}{1+ce^{-k [-\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)]}} = \frac{A}{1+ce^{\ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)}} = \frac{A}{1+c \cdot \frac{1}{c}} = \frac{A}{2}
            </me>.
            Thus,
            the inflection point on the graph of <m>L</m> is located at  <m>( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right), \frac{A}{2})</m>.

            Write several sentences to describe the overall behavior of a typical function <m>L</m> and how this behavior depends on <m>A</m>,

        <answer/>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We have shown that <m>L</m> is an always increasing function that has horizontal asymptotes at <m>y =0</m> and <m>y = A</m>,
            as well as an inflection point at <m>( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right), \frac{A}{2})</m>,
            which we note lies vertically halfway between the asymptotes.
            In addition, we see that <m>L(0) = \frac{A}{1+c}</m>.
            The combination of all of this information shows us that a typical graph in this family of functions is given by the following figure.
