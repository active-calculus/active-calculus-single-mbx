            It costs $800 to make 2000 feet of rope.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>C(2000) = 800</m> and <m>C'(2000) = 0.35</m>.
            Estimate <m>C(2100)</m>,
            and justify your estimate by writing at least one sentence that explains your thinking.

        <hint>
          <p>
            How much do you expect <m>C</m> to increase for each additional foot away from 2000?
            By how many feet will the input increase to get to 2100?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m>C(2100) \approx = 835</m>,.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If <m>C(2000) = 800</m> and <m>C'(2000) = 0.35</m>,
            then we know once 2000 feet of rope are produced,
            the total cost function is increasing at $0.35 per additional foot of rope.
            Then, if we manufacture an additional 100 feet of rope,
            the additional total cost will be approximately
            <me>
              100 \ \text{feet}  \cdot 0.35 \ \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{foot} } = 35 \ \text{dollars}
            </me>.
            Therefore,
            we find that <m>C(2100) \approx C(2000) + 35 = 835</m>,
            or that the cost to make 2100 feet of rope is about $835.

            Do you think <m>C'(2000)</m> is less than, equal to,

            Why?

        <hint>
          <p>
            In manufacturing processes,
            there is often a decrease in cost per unit as the number of units increases.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Either <m>C'(2000) = C'(3000)</m> or <m>C'(2000) &gt; C'(3000)</m>.

        <solution>

            Either <m>C'(2000) = C'(3000)</m> or <m>C'(2000) &gt; C'(3000)</m>,
            since we expect the cost per foot of additional rope to either stay constant or to get smaller as the production volume increases.
            Said differently,
            the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost function should either be constant or decrease due to economy of scale.

            Suppose someone claims that <m>C'(5000) = -0.1</m>.
            What would the practical meaning of this derivative value tell you about the approximate cost of the next foot of rope?
            Is this possible?
            Why or why not?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Is it possible for the total cost function to be decreasing at some point?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Impossible.
            The total cost function <m>C(r)</m> can never decrease.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            It is impossible to have
            <m>C'(5000) = -0.1</m> and indeed to have any negative derivative value for the total cost function.
            The total cost function <m>C(r)</m> can never decrease,
            because it doesn't make sense for the total cost of producing 5001 feet of rope to be less than the total cost of producing 5000 feet of rope.
