            Use the left-hand graph to determine the values of <m>f(2)</m>,

            From the given graph, we observe that <m>f(2) = 0</m>,

            By L'Hôpital's Rule,

              \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(2)}{g'(2)} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{4} = \frac{1}{8}

            Use the middle graph to find <m>p(2)</m>,

            Do the functions <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> meet the criteria of L'Hôpital's Rule?

        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m> \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = 1</m>.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The given graph tells us that <m>p(2) = 1.5</m>,
            <m>p'(2)=-1</m>, <m>q(2)=1.5</m>, and <m>q'(2)=0</m>.
            Note well that the given limit,
            <me>
              \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
            </me>,
            is not indeterminate, and thus L'Hôpital's Rule does not apply.
            Rather, since <m>p(x) \to 1.5</m> and
            <m>q(x) \to 1.5</m> as <m>x \to 2</m>, we have that
            <me>
              \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{p(2)}{q(2)} = \frac{1.5}{1.5} = 1
            </me>.
          </p>

      <task workspace="3cm" xml:id="act-2-8-2-task-2">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Assume that <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are functions whose for which
            <m>r''(2) \ne 0</m> and <m>s''(2) \ne 0</m>
            Use the right-hand graph to compute <m>r(2)</m>,
            <m>r'(2)</m>, <m>s(2)</m>, <m>s'(2)</m>.
            Explain why you cannot determine the exact value of
            <m>\lim\limits_{x \to 2} \frac{r(x)}{s(x)}</m> without further information being provided,
            but that you can determine the sign of <m>\lim\limits_{x \to 2} \frac{r(x)}{s(x)}</m>.
            In addition,
            state what the sign of the limit will be, with justification.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Remember that L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied more than once to a particular limit.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m> \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{r(x)}{s(x)} \lt 0</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            From the third graph,  <m>r(2)=0</m>,
            <m>r'(2)=0</m>, <m>s(2)=0</m>, <m>s'(2)=0</m>.
            By L'Hôpital's Rule,
            <me>
              \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{r(x)}{s(x)} = \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{r'(x)}{s'(x)}
            </me>,
            but this limit is still indeterminate,
            so by L'Hôpital's Rule again,
            <me>
              \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{r(x)}{s(x)} = \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{r''(x)}{s''(x)} = \frac{r''(2)}{s''(2)}
            </me>,
            provided that <m>s''(2) \ne 0</m>.
            Since we do not know the values of <m>r''(2)</m> and <m>s''(2)</m>,
            we can't determine the actual value of the limit,
            but from the graph it appears that <m>r''(2) \gt 0</m>
            (since <m>r</m> is concave up)
            and that <m>s''(2) \lt  0</m>
            (because <m>s</m> is concave down),
            and therefore
            <me>
              \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{r(x)}{s(x)} \lt  0
            </me>.
