      The following prompts in this activity will lead you to develop the derivative of the inverse tangent function.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>r(x) = \arctan(x)</m>.
            Use the relationship between the arctangent and tangent functions to rewrite this equation using only the tangent function.

        <hint>
          <p>
            Recall that for any function and its inverse,
            writing <m>y = f^{-1}(x)</m> is equivalent to writing <m>f(y) = x</m>.

          <p><m>\tan(r(x)) = x</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since <m>r(x) = \arctan(x)</m>,
            it is equivalent to write <m>\tan(r(x)) = x</m>.

            Differentiate both sides of the equation you found in (a).
            Solve the resulting equation for <m>r'(x)</m>,
            writing <m>r'(x)</m> as simply as possible in terms of a trigonometric function evaluated at <m>r(x)</m>.

          <p><m> r'(x) = \cos^2(r(x))</m>.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Differentiating,
            we have <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(r(x))] = \frac{d}{dx}[x]</m>, so
            <me>
              \sec^2(r(x)) r'(x) = 1
            </me>,
            and thus
            <me>
              r'(x) = \frac{1}{\sec^2(r(x))} = \cos^2(r(x))
            </me>,
            since <m>\frac{1}{\sec(\alpha)} = \cos(\alpha)</m>.

            Recall that <m>r(x) = \arctan(x)</m>.
            Update your expression for <m>r'(x)</m> so that it only involves trigonometric functions and the independent variable <m>x</m>.

          <p>
            Since <m>r(x) = \arctan(x)</m>,

        <statement>
          <p>
            Introduce a right triangle with angle <m>\theta</m> so that <m>\theta = \arctan(x)</m>.
            What are the three sides of the triangle?

        <hint>
          <p>
            Let the vertical leg of the triangle be <m>x</m>.
            What must the horizontal leg be?

            With <m>\theta = \arctan(x)</m>,
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Letting <m>\theta = \arctan(x)</m>,
            it follows that we can view <m>\theta</m> as an angle in a right triangle with legs <m>1</m> and <m>x</m> (so that <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{1}</m>,
            and thus by the Pythagorean Theorem,
            the triangle's hypotenuse is <m>\sqrt{1+x^2}</m>,
            as shown below.

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Recall that the cosine of an angle is the length of the adjacent leg over the length of they hypotenuse.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To evaluate <m>\cos(\arctan(x))</m>,
            we use the right triangle developed in (d) and observe that
            <me>
              \cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}
            </me>.

            Use the results of your work above to find an expression involving only <m>1</m> and <m>x</m> for <m>r'(x)</m>.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Finally,
            we recall that we know <m>r'(x) = \cos^2(\arctan(x)) = \left( \cos(\arctan(x)) \right)^2</m>.
            Having established that <m>\cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}</m>,
            we now have that
            <me>
              r'(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}
            </me>.
