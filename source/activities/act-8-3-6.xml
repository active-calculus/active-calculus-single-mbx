      <p>
      Consider the series <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m>.
      Since the convergence or divergence of a series only depends on the behavior of the series for large values of <m>k</m>,
      we might examine the terms of this series more closely as <m>k</m> gets large.

            By computing the value of
            <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> for <m>k = 100</m> and <m>k = 1000</m>,
            explain why the terms <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> are essentially
            <m>\frac{k}{k^3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.

      <answer>
        <p><m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> looks like
            <m>\frac{k}{k^3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            When <m>k</m> is very large,
            the constant 1 in the numerator is negligible compared to <m>k</m> and the constant 2 in the denominator is negligible compared to <m>k^3</m>.
            So the numerator looks like <m>k</m> and the denominator <m>k^3</m> when <m>k</m> is large.
            It follows that <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> looks like
            <m>\frac{k}{k^3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.

      <statement>
        <p>
            Let's formalize our observations in (a) a bit more.
            Let <m>a_k =  \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> and <m>b_k =  \frac{k}{k^3}</m>.
            Calculate
            <me>
              \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k}
            </me>.
            What does the value of the limit tell you about <m>a_k</m> and <m>b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>?
            Compare your response from part (a).

      <answer>
        <p><m>
            \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} = 1
            </m>
            so <m>a_k \approx b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Note that
            <md><mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{k+1}{k^3+2} }{ \frac{k}{k^3} }</mrow><mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{(k+1)k^3}{k(k^3+2)}</mrow><mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1+\frac{1}{k}}{1+\frac{2}{k}}</mrow><mrow>\amp = 1</mrow></md>.
            This tells us that <m>a_k \approx b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>,
            which is what we suggested in part (a).

            Does the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3}</m> converge or diverge?
            Why?
            What do you think that tells us about the convergence or divergence of the series <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m>?
            Explain.

      <answer>
        <p><m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> converges.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Since <m>\frac{k}{k^3} = \frac{1}{k^2}</m>,
            the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3}</m> is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p=2</m> and so converges.
            Since <m>a_k \approx b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>,
            it seems reasonable to expect that <m>\sum a_k \approx \sum b_k</m> for large <m>k</m>s.
            Since <m>\sum a_k</m> is finite,
            we should then conclude that <m>\sum b_k</m> is also finite.
            So <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> should be a convergent series.
