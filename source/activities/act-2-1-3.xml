            Find the slope of the tangent line to

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Note that since <m>h(z) = z^{1/2} + z^{-1}</m>,
            we have <m>h'(z) = \frac{1}{2}z^{-1/2} - z^{-2}</m>.
            Thus,
            <m>h'(4) = \frac{1}{2(4)^{1/2}} - \frac{1}{4^2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{16}</m>.
            Thus, the slope of the tangent line to <m>h(z)</m> at the point where <m>z = 4</m> is <m>\frac{3}{16}</m>.

            Think about finding both <m>P'(t)</m> and <m>P''(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            (i.)<m>P'(4) = 2(1.37)^4 \ln(1.37) \approx 2.218</m> million cells per day; (ii.) the population is growing at an increasing rate.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            For (i.), note that <m>P'(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37)</m>,
            and therefore <m>P'(4) = 2(1.37)^4 \ln(1.37) \approx 2.218</m> million cells per day.
            For (ii.), we can compute <m>P''(t)</m> and find that
            <m>P''(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37) \ln(1.37)</m> and therefore find that <m>P''(4) \approx 0.69825</m>.
            Since <m>P''(4)</m> is positive,
            this tells us that the instantaneous rate of change <m>P'(t)</m> is increasing at <m>t = 4</m>,
            and thus the population is growing at an increasing rate.

            Find an equation for the tangent line to the curve

            What two important pieces of information do you need to know to determine the equation of a line?

        <answer>
          <p><m>y - 25 = -33(a+1)</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Given <m>p(a) = 3a^4 - 2a^3 + 7a^2 - a + 12</m>,
            first observe that <m>p(-1) = 3 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 12 = 25</m>,
            so the tangent line will pass through <m>(-1,25)</m>.
            Further, since <m>p'(a) = 12a^3 - 6a^2 + 14a - 1</m>,
            we have <m>p'(-1) = -12 - 6 - 14 - 1 = -33</m>,
            which is the slope of the tangent line.
            The equation of the tangent line is therefore <m>y - 25 = -33(a+1)</m>.

            What is the difference between being asked to find the <em>slope</em>
            of the tangent line (asked in (a)) and the <em>equation</em>
            of the tangent line (asked in (c))?

        <hint>
          <p>
            What information do you find in both (a) and (c)?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The slope is a number,
            while the equation is, well, an equation.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The biggest difference is that (a) asks for the
            <em>slope</em> of the tangent line,
            while (c) asks for the <em>equation</em> of the tangent line.
            The latter requires the slope of the tangent line,
            but the slope and equation are two different entities.
