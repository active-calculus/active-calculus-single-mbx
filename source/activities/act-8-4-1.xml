    <introduction>
      <p>
      Remember that, by definition,
      a series converges if and only if its corresponding sequence of partial sums converges.

      <statement>
        <p>
            Calculate the first few partial sums (to 10 decimal places) of the alternating series
            <me>
              \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k}

            Label each partial sum with the notation <m>S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k}</m> for
            an appropriate choice of <m>n</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
            Plot the sequence of partial sums from part (a).
            What do you notice about this sequence?
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint/>
      <answer>
        <p>
            There appears to be a limit for the sequence of partial sums.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            The entries in the sequence of partial sums from part (a) is shown in the figure below.
          </p>
        <p>
            Notice that the partial sums seem to oscillate back and forth around some fixed number,
            getting closer to that fixed number at each successive step.
            So there appears to be a limit for this sequence of partial sums.
