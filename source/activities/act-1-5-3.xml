    <introduction>
      <p>
      Researchers at a major car company have found a function that relates gasoline consumption to speed for a particular model of car.
      In particular,
      they have determined that the consumption <m>C</m>,
      in <em>liters per kilometer</em>,
      at a given speed <m>s</m>,
      is given by a function <m>C = f(s)</m>,
      where <m>s</m> is the car's speed in
      <em>kilometers per hour</em>.

      <statement>
        <p>
            Data provided by the car company tells us that <m>f(80) = 0.015</m>,
            <m>f(90) = 0.02</m>, and <m>f(100) = 0.027</m>.
            Use this information to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of fuel consumption with respect to speed at <m>s = 90</m>.
            Be as accurate as possible,
            use proper notation, and include units on your answer.

        <p><m>f'(90) \approx 0.0006</m> liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.

      <solution>
        <p>
            Using a central difference, we have
            <me>
              f'(90) \approx \frac{f(100) - f(80}{100-80} = \frac{0.027 - 0.015}{20} = \frac{0.012}{20} = 0.0006
            </me>
            which tells us that
            <m>f'(90) \approx 0.0006</m> liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.

            What is happening when the car is traveling at 80 km/hr?

      <answer>
        <p>
            At 80 kilometers per hour,
            the car is using fuel at a rate of 0.015 liters per kilometer.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            When the car is traveling at 80 kilometers per hour,
            it is using fuel at a rate of 0.015 liters per kilometer.
            That is, at the given speed,
            for each additional kilometer the car travels,
            it uses an additional 0.015 liters of fuel.

      <answer>
        <p>
            When the car is traveling at 90 kilometers per hour,
            its rate of fuel consumption per kilometer is increasing at a rate of 0.0006 liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            To say that <m>f'(90) = 0.0006</m> liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour means that when the car is traveling at 90 kilometers per hour,
            its rate of fuel consumption per kilometer is increasing at a rate of 0.0006 liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.
            If we increase our speed from 90 to 91 km/hr,
            we would expect our rate of fuel consumption to rise by 0.0006 liters for each additional kilometer driven.
