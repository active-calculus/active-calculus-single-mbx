    <introduction>
      <p>
      For each of the following functions,
      sketch an accurate graph of the antiderivative that satisfies the given initial condition.
      In addition,
      sketch the graph of two additional antiderivatives of the given function,
      and state the corresponding initial conditions that each of them satisfy.
      If possible,
      find an algebraic formula for the antiderivative that satisfies the initial condition.

        <p>
            Thinking both graphically and algebraically reveals that the antiderivative we seek is <m>H(x) = -\cos(x) + 2</m>.
            Any vertical shift of this function will have the same derivative,
            but will have a different <m>y</m>-intercept.
