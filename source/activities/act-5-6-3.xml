      Consider the functions <m>f(x) = 2-x^2</m>, <m>g(x) = 2-x^3</m>,

            Think about trends in over- and under-estimates.

        <p>
            Left endpoint rule results are overestimates;
            right endpoint rules are underestimates;
            midpoint rules are overestimates;
            trapezoid rules are underestimates.
            Simpson's rule is exact for both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
            while a slight underestimate of <m>\int_0^1 h(x) dx</m>.

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            We observe that each of the left endpoint rule results are overestimates,
            each of the right endpoint rules are underestimates,
            each of the midpoint rules are overestimates,
            and each of the trapezoid rules are underestimates.
            These results hold because each of the three functions are both decreasing and concave down.
            For Simpson's rule,
            we see that the result is exact for both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
            while Simpson's rule is a slight underestimate of <m>\int_0^1 h(x) dx</m>.
