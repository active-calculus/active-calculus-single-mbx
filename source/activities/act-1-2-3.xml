      Assume that <m>s</m> is measured in feet and <m>t</m> is measured in seconds.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Use the graph to estimate the average velocity of the object on each of the following intervals:
            <m>[0.5,1]</m>, <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>, <m>[0,5]</m>.
            Draw each line whose slope represents the average velocity you seek.

        <hint>
          <p>
            Remember that average velocity on an interval computes the quotient of
            <q>change in <m>s</m> over change in <m>t</m>.</q>
            This is the slope of the line between the corresponding two points on the graph of <m>s</m>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            The average velocity on <m>[0.5,1]</m> is the slope of the line joining the points <m>(0.5,s(0.5))</m> and <m>(1,s(1))</m>,
            which is <m>AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{1-1}{1-0.5} = 0</m>.
            On <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>, we similarly find
            <m>AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = \frac{3-1}{2.5-1.5} = 2</m>, and on <m>[0,5]</m>,
            we have <m>AV_{[0,5]} = \frac{5-0}{5-0} = 1</m>.

            How could you use average velocities or slopes of lines to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the object at a fixed time?

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Think about shorter and shorter time intervals and drawing the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.

        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.
            If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number,
            that number represents the instantaneous velocity.  
          </p>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity.
            If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number,
            that number represents the instantaneous velocity.
            For example,
            to estimate the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 2</m>,
            we might consider average velocities on <m>[2,3]</m>,
            <m>[2,2.5]</m>, and <m>[2,2.25]</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Use the graph to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the object when <m>t = 2</m>.
            Should this instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 2</m> be greater or less than the average velocity on
            <m>[1.5,2.5]</m> that you computed in (a)?
            Why?  
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Think about zooming in on the graph at <m>t = 2</m> and drawing a line that,
            up close,
            looks just like the curve <m>s(t)</m>.
            What is the approximate slope of that line?  
          </p>
          </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 2</m> is greater than the average velocity on <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If we draw the line through <m>(2,2)</m> and <m>(2.1,s(2.1))</m>,
            it looks like the line's slope is approximately 2.5:
            if we go over one grid-width,
            we appear to go up about 2.5.
            The slope of this line is clearly greater than the slope of the line through
            <m>(1.5, s(1.5))</m> and <m>(2.5, s(2.5))</m>, which is 2.
            Hence the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 2</m> is greater than the average velocity on <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>.
