            Suppose that a patient is given morphine intravenously at the rate of 3 milligrams per hour.
            Write a differential equation that combines the intravenous administration of morphine with the body's natural absorption.

      <solution>
        <p>
            Noting that the rate of change of the drug in the body will be the differnce between the positive contributions of the dosage of 3 milligrams per hour and the decay of <m>kM</m> per hour,
            it follows that
            <m>\frac{dM}{dt} = 3 - kM</m>,

            Find any equilibrium solutions and determine their stability.

      <hint/>
      <answer>
        <p>
            The equilibrium solution <m>mM = \frac{3}{k}</m> is stable.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            To find the equilibrium solutions,
            we solve the equation <m>\frac{dM}{dt} = 0</m> for <m>M</m>.
            This gives <m>M = \frac{3}{k}</m>.
            The graph of <m>\frac{dM}{dt}</m> as a function of <m>M</m> is a straight line with a negative slope.
            (The slope is <m>-k</m>.)
            So when <m>M \lt \frac{3}{k}</m>,
            <m>\frac{dM}{dt} \gt 0</m> and the <m>M</m> is an increasing function of <m>t</m>.
            When <m>M \gt \frac{3}{k}</m>,
            <m>\frac{dM}{dt} \lt 0</m> and the <m>M</m> is a decreasing function of <m>t</m>.
            This means that the equilibrium solution
            <m>mM = \frac{3}{k}</m> is a stable equilibrium solution.

      <solution>
        <p>
            We use the initial condition <m>M = 0</m> when <m>t = 0</m> and solve the corresponding IVP.  Separating variables,
            <me>
              \frac{1}{3 - kM} \frac{dM}{dt} = 1
            </me>,
            so
            <me>
              \int \frac{1}{3 - kM} dM = \int 1 dt
            </me>,
            and thus
            <me>
              -\frac{1}{k} \ln |3 - kM | = t + c
            </me>.
            Solving for <m>M</m> in the usual way gives us
            <me>
              M = \frac{1}{k} \left( 3 - Ae^{-kt} \right)
            </me>,
            where <m>A</m> is a constant that arises from the integration constant.
            Using the initial condition, we obtain
            <m> 0 = \frac{1}{k} ( 3 - A)</m>, so <m>A = 3</m>.
            Hence, the solution to the initial condition problem is <m>M = \frac{1}{k} \left( 3 - 3e^{-kt} \right) = \frac{3}{k} \left( 1 - e^{-kt} \right)</m>.

            To what rate should a doctor reduce the intravenous rate so that there is eventually 7 milligrams of morphine in the patient's bloodstream?
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint/>
      <answer>
        <p>
            About 2.426 milligrams per hour.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            We let <m>q</m> be the unknown intravenous rate of morphine
            (in milligrams per hour).
            Notice that if we replace <m>3</m> with <m>q</m> in the differential equation and obtain <m>\frac{dM}{dt} = q - kM</m>,
            the solution process is the same and the equilibriume solution is <m>M = \frac{q}{k}</m>.
            So if we want the equilibrium solution to be <m>M = 7</m>,
            we then have <m>\frac{q}{k} = 7</m>,
            so <m>q = 7k \approx 2.426</m>.
            The intravenous rate of morphine should be 2.426 milligrams per hour.
