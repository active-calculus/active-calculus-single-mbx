      Consider the differential equation

            Identify any equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable.

      <hint/>
      <answer>
        <p><m>y = 0</m> or <m>y = 6</m>; <m>y = 0</m> is unstable, <m>y = 6</m> is stable.

      <solution>
        <p>
            If <m>y</m> is an equilibrium solution,
            then <m>y</m> is constant so <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 0</m>.
            Solving <m>0 = 6y - y^2</m>, we see that either <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y = 6</m>,
            which is also consistent with what we see in the slope field.  In addition, <m>y = 0</m> is unstable because nearby solutions tend away from <m>y = 0</m>, while <m>y = 6</m> is stable since nearby solutions tend to <m>y = 6</m>.

            The long-term behavior of the solution that satisfies the initial value

            Using the initial value <m>y(0) = 1</m>,
            use Euler's method with
            <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m> to approximate the solution at <m>t_i = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8</m>,

            Record your results in <xref ref="T-7-3-act-2">Table</xref>

            <m>(t_i, y_i)</m> on the axes provided in <xref ref="F-7-3-act-2">Figure</xref>.
            Note the different horizontal scale on the axes in <xref ref="F-7-3-act-2">Figure</xref>

        <p>
            Using Euler's method with <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m>,
            we approximate the solution of the IVP at <m>t_i = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8</m>,
            and <m>1.0</m> as shown in the following table and figure.
            We see that our estimates actually jump slightly above the equilibrium solution before being pulled back down.

            the value of <m>y_i = 6</m> for every value of <m>i</m> since <m>y=6</m> is an equilibrium solution and the slope of the tangent line will always be <m>0</m>.
