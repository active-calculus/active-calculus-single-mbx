      Consider the series defined by
      <men xml:id="eq-8-3-ratio-example">
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}
      </men>.
    </p>
        <p>
      This series is not a geometric series,
      but this activity will illustrate how we might compare this series to a geometric one.
      Recall that a series <m>\sum a_k</m> is geometric if the ratio <m>\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}</m> is always the same.
      For the series in <xref ref="eq-8-3-ratio-example"/>, note that <m>a_k = \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m>.

            To see if <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> is comparable to a geometric series,
            we analyze the ratios of successive terms in the series.
            Complete <xref ref="T-8-3-3-ratio-test">Table</xref>,
            listing your calculations to at least 8 decimal places.

            Ratios of successive summands in the series are shown (to 10 decimal places) in the following table.

            Based on your calculations in <xref ref="T-8-3-3-ratio-test">Table</xref>,
            what can we say about the ratio
            <m>\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}</m> if <m>k</m> is large?

          <p><m>\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \approx \frac{2}{3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The calculations in the table in part (a) seem to indicate that the ratio <m>\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}</m> is roughly
            <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.

            Do you agree or disagree with the statement:
            <q>the series <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> is approximately geometric when <m>k</m> is large</q>?
            If not, why not?
            If so, do you think the series
            <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> converges or diverges?
            Explain.
          </p>

        <hint/>
        <answer>
          <p><m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> converges.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since <m>\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \approx \frac{2}{3}</m> for large <m>k</m>,
            the series <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> is approximately the same as
            <m>\sum \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k</m> when <m>k</m> is large.
            So the series <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> is approximately geometric with ratio
            <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.
            Since the series <m>\sum \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k</m> converges because the ratio is less than 1, we expect that the series <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> will also converge.
