      <introduction>
        <p>
      In each of the following problems,
      determine the total force exerted by water against the surface that is described.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider a rectangular dam that is 100 feet wide and 50 feet tall,
            and suppose that water presses against the dam all the way to the top.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Put the center of the top of the dam at the origin and let the positive <m>x</m>-axis point down.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p><m> F = \int_{x = 0}^{x=50} (6240 x) dx = 7~800~000 \text{ pounds } </m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We let the positive <m>x</m>-axis point down and let <m>x</m> be the distance from the top of the dam.
            The area of a typical horizontal slice
            (in square feet)
            is
            <me>
              A_{\text{ slice } } = 100 \Delta x
            </me>.
            The pressure
            (in pounds per square foot)
            at depth <m>x</m> is given by <m>P_{\text{ slice } } = 62.5 x</m>.
            So the force on a typical slice
            (in pounds)
            is
            <me>
              F_{\text{ slice } } = (62.4x)(100 \Delta x) = 6240 x \Delta x

            So the force of the water against the dam is

            Consider a semicircular dam with a radius of 30 feet.
            Suppose that the water rises to within 10 feet of the top of the dam.

        <hint>
          <p>
            With the positive <m>x</m>-axis pointing down,
            the equation for the edge of the semi-circular dam is <m>y = \sqrt{900-x^2}</m>.

        <answer>
          <p><m> F = \int_{x=10}^{x=30} 124.8 (x - 10)\sqrt{900 - x^2} dx = 800~244 \text{ pounds } </m>.

            We let the positive <m>x</m>-axis point down and let <m>x</m> be the distance from the top of the dam.
            We place the top of the dam along the <m>x</m>-axis with the center at the origin.
            So the equation for the semicircle is
            <m>y = \sqrt{30^2 - x^2} = \sqrt{900 - x^2}</m>.
            The area of a typical horizontal slice

            </me>.
            At a given value of <m>x</m>,
            the depth of the water is <m>(x - 10)</m>.
            So the pressure
            (in pounds per square foot)
            at  <m>x</m> is given by <m>P_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4 (x - 10)</m>.
            So the force on a typical slice

              F_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4(x - 10) \left(2 \sqrt{900 - x^2} \Delta x \right) = 124.8 (x - 10)\sqrt{900 - x^2} \Delta x

              F = \int_{x=10}^{x=30} 124.8 (x - 10)\sqrt{900 - x^2} dx = 426~488 \text{ pounds }

            Consider a trough with triangular ends,

            We let the positive <m>x</m>-axis point down and let <m>x</m> be the distance from the top of the dam.
            We place the top of the trough along the <m>x</m>-axis with the center at the origin.
            We need the equation for the straight line from the point
            <m>(0, 2.5)</m> to the point <m>(4, 0)</m>.
            The equation for this line is <m>y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 2.5 = 2.5 - 0.625x</m>.
            The area of a typical horizontal slice
            (in square feet)
            is
            <me>
              A_{\text{ slice } } = 2y \Delta x = 2(2.5 - 0.625x) \Delta x = (5 - 1.25x)  \Delta x
            </me>.
            At a given value of <m>x</m>,
            the depth of the water is <m>(x - 1)</m>.
            So the pressure
            (in pounds per square foot)
            at  <m>x</m> is given by <m>P_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4 (x - 1)</m>.
            So the force on a typical slice
            (in pounds)
            is
            <me>
              F_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4(x - 1) \left( 5 - 1.25x \Delta x \right) = 62.4 (x - 1)(5 - 1.25x) \Delta x

            So the force of the water against the trough is
