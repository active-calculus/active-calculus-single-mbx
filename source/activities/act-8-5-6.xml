              <p>
                  Let <m>x \ge 0</m>.
                  Since <m>f(x) = e^x</m>,
                  <m>f^{(n)}(x) = e^x</m> for every natural number <m>n</m>.
                  Since <m>e^x</m> is an increasing function,
                  we know that <m>|f^{(n)}(x)| \le e^c</m> on the interval <m>[0,c]</m> for any fixed positive value of <m>c</m>.
                  Thus, by the Lagrange error formula, we can say that
                  <me>
                    |P_n(x) - e^x| \le e^c \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}
                  </me>.
                  Since the series <m>\sum \frac{x^{n}}{n!}</m> converges for every <m>x</m>,
                  <m>\frac{x^{n}}{n!} \to 0</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
                  and thus <m>\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \to 0</m> as
                  <m>n \to \infty</m> for every <m>x</m> in <m>[0,c]</m>.
                  Further, since <m>e^c</m> is a constant independent of <m>n</m>,
                  <m>e^c \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \to 0</m> as well.
                  Thus,
                  <me>
                    \lim_{n \to \infty} |P_n(x) - e^x| = 0
                  </me>,
                  as desired.

              <p>
                  When <m>x \lt 0</m>, we know <m>e^x \lt 1</m>.
                  Thus, we can repeat our argument in (a) but replace <m>e^c</m> with <m>1</m>,
                  and everything else holds in the same way.

                  Because we have shown that the Taylor series for <m>e^x</m> converges to <m>e^x</m> for both every nonnegative <m>x</m>-value and for every negative <m>x</m>-value,
                  it follows that we have convergence for every value of <m>x</m>.

        <p><m>n = 28</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Since <m>e^x</m> is increasing on <m>[0,5]</m> we know that <m>e^x \lt e^5</m> on <m>[0,5]</m>.
            Now <m>e^5 \lt 243</m>, so
            <me>
              \left|P_n(5) - e^5\right| \leq 243\frac{|5|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}
            </me>.
            We want a value of <m>n</m>that makes this error term less than <m>10^{-8}</m>.
            Testing various values of <m>n</m> gives
            <me>
              243\frac{|5|^{28+1}}{(28+1)!} \approx 5.119146745 \times 10^{-9}
            </me>
            so we can choose <m>n = 28</m>.
            A computer algebra system shows that <m>P_{28}(5) \approx 148.413159102551</m> while
            <m>e^5 \approx 148.413159102577</m> and we can see that these two approximations agree to 8 decimal places.
