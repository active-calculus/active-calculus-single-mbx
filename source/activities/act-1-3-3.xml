      A rapidly growing city in Arizona has its population <m>P</m> at time <m>t</m>,

      modeled by the formula <m>P(t) = 25000 e^{t/5}</m>.
      Use this function to respond to the following questions.

            Use the limit definition to write an expression for the instantaneous rate of change of <m>P</m> with respect to time,

        <hint>
          <p>
            Because of the exponential nature of <m>P(t)</m>,
          we're not able to simplify
          <m>\frac{P(2+h)-P(2)}{h}</m> in a way that removes <m>h</m> from the denominator.

          </me>
          Because there is no way to remove a factor of <m>h</m> from the numerator,
          we cannot eliminate the <m>h</m> that is making the denominator go to zero.

          Because there is no way to remove a factor of <m>h</m> from the numerator,

          <p>
            Using <m>h = 0.00001</m>,
          we find <m>\frac{P(2+0.00001)-P(2)}{0.00001} \approx 7457</m>;
