            Since the population <m>P(t)</m> of the town is growing at an annual rate of <m>3\%</m> per year,
            this means that <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.03 P</m></p>

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            We use separation of variables and write <m>\frac{1}{P} \frac{dP}{dt} = 1.03</m>.
            We then have
            <me>
              \int \frac{1}{P} \frac{dP}{dt} dt = \int 0.03 dt
            </me>
            and thus <m>\int \frac{1}{P} dP = \int 0.03 dt</m>.
            Evaluating the integrals on each side, we have
            <m>\ln|P| = 0.03 t + c</m>
            By definition of the logarithm function, it follows that
            <me>
              |P| = e^{0.03t + c} = e^c e^{0.03t} = C e^{0.03t}
            </me>.
            Incorporating the <m>\pm</m> that follows from the abslute value sign into the constant <m>C</m>,
            we conclude that <m>P = Ce^{0.03t}</m>.

            If you know that the town's population in year 0 is 10,000,

          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Given that <m>P(0) = 10000</m>,
            we see that <m>10000 = C e^0 = C</m>.
            So

            How long does it take for the population to double?
            This time is called the <em>doubling time</em>.
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint/>
      <answer>
        <p>
            The doubling time is <m>t = \frac{\ln(2)}{0.03} \approx 23.105</m> years.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            The population will have doubled when <m>P = 200000</m>.
            To determine the time it takes the population to double,
            we solve the equation
            <me>
              10000 e^{0.03t} = 20000
            </me>.
            Thus <m>e^{0.03t} = 2</m>, so <m>t = \frac{\ln(2)}{0.03} \approx 23.105</m>.
            It will take about 23.1 years for the population to double in size.

        <p>
            Working more generally,
            find the doubling time if the annual growth rate is <m>k</m> times the population.
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint/>
      <answer>
        <p>
            The doubling time is <m>t = \frac{1}{k} \ln(2)</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            If the annual growth rate is <m>k</m>,
            then the differential equation for the population is
            <me>
              \frac{dP}{dt} = kP
            </me>.
            We can use separation of variables to show that <m>P = P_0 e^{kt}</m>,
            where <m>P_0</m> is the population at time <m>t = 0</m>.
            We then find the doubling time by solving the equation <m>P_0 e^{kt} = 2P_0</m>.
            We first solve for <m>e^{kt}</m> and get <m>e^{kt} = 2</m>.
            Taking natural logs, <m>kt = \ln(2)</m>,
            and dividing by <m>k</m>, <m>t = \frac{1}{k} \ln(2)</m>.
            The doubling time for the population is thus <m>\frac{1}{k} \ln(2)</m>.
