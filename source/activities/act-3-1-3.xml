            Use a graphing utility to sketch the graph of <m>h</m> for several different <m>k</m>-values,
            including <m>k = 1,3,5,10</m>.
            Plot <m>h(x) = x^2 + \cos(3x)</m> on the axes provided.
            What is the smallest value of <m>k</m> at which you think you can see
            (just by looking at the graph)
            at least one inflection point on the graph of <m>h</m>?

            If <m>\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1</m>,
            then the equation <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has no solution.
            Hence, whenever <m>k^2 \lt 2</m>,
            or <m>k \lt \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414</m>,
            it follows that the equation
            <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has no solutions <m>x</m>,
            which means that <m>h''(x)</m> is never zero (indeed,
            for these <m>k</m>-values,
            <m>h''(x)</m> is always positive so that <m>h</m> is always concave up).
            On the other hand, if <m>k \ge \sqrt{2}</m>,
            then <m>\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1</m>,
            which guarantees that
            <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has infinitely many solutions,
            due to the periodicity of the cosine function.
            At each such point, <m>h''(x) = 2 - k^2 \cos(kx)</m> changes sign,
            and therefore <m>h</m> has infinitely many inflection points whenever <m>k \ge \sqrt{2}</m>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Treating <m>k</m> as an arbitrary constant,
            we first observe that <m>h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)</m>.
            Again treating <m>k</m> as a constant and differentiating, we find
            <me>
              h''(x) = 2 - k^2\cos(kx)
            </me>.
            We seek the values of <m>x</m> for which
            <m>h''(x) = 0</m> at which <m>h''</m> changes sign.
            Setting <m>h''(x) = 0</m> and rearranging the resulting equation,
            we now seek <m>x</m> such that
            <me>
              k^2 \cos(kx) = 2
            </me>,
            or
            <me>
              \cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}
            </me>.
            Now, remember that <m>k</m> is an arbitrary positive constant and recall that
            <m>-1 \le \cos(\theta) \le 1</m> for all input values <m>\theta</m>.
            If <m>\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1</m>,
            then the equation <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has no solution.
            Hence, whenever <m>k^2 \lt  2</m>,
            or <m>k \lt  \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414</m>,
            it follows that the equation
            <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has no solutions <m>x</m>,
            which means that <m>h''(x)</m> is never zero (indeed,
            for these <m>k</m>-values,
            <m>h''(x)</m> is always positive so that <m>h</m> is always concave up).

            On the other hand,
            if <m>k \ge \sqrt{2}</m>,
            then <m>\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1</m>,
            which guarantees that
            <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has infinitely many solutions,
            due to the periodicity of the cosine function.
            At each such point, <m>h''(x) = 2 - k^2 \cos(kx)</m> changes sign,
            and therefore <m>h</m> has infinitely many inflection points whenever <m>k \ge \sqrt{2}</m>.

            How many times can <m>y = k\sin(kx)</m> intersect the line <m>y = 2x</m>?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            To see why <m>h</m> can only have a finite number of critical numbers regardless of the value of <m>k</m>,
            consider the equation
            <me>
              0 = h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)
            </me>,
            which implies that <m>2x = k\sin(kx)</m>.
            Since <m>-1 \le \sin(kx) \le 1</m>,
            we know that <m>-k \le k\sin(kx) \le k</m>.
            Once <m>|x|</m> is sufficiently large,
            we are guaranteed that <m>|2x| \gt k</m>,
            which means that for large <m>x</m>,
            <m>2x</m> and <m>k\sin(kx)</m> cannot intersect.
            Moreover, for relatively small values of <m>x</m>,
            the functions <m>2x</m> and
            <m>k\sin(kx)</m> can only intersect finitely many times since
            <m>k\sin(kx)</m> oscillates a finite number of times.
            This is why <m>h</m> can only have a finite number of critical numbers,
            regardless of the value of <m>k</m>.
