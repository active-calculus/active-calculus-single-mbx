      <introduction>
        <p>
      For quantities of equal weight,
      such as two children on a teeter-totter,
      the balancing point is found by taking the average of their locations.
      When the weights of the quantities differ,
      we use a weighted average of their respective locations to find the balancing point.

            Suppose that a shelf is 6 feet long,
            with its left end situated at <m>x = 0</m>.
            If one book of weight 1 lb is placed at <m>x_1 = 0</m>,
            and another book of weight 1 lb is placed at <m>x_2 = 6</m>,
            what is the location of <m>\overline{x}</m>,

            We can think of the weighted books almost as if there were that <em>number</em>
            of 1-lb books at each location.
            The balancing point is given by the weighted average
            <me>
              \overline{x} = \frac{2x_1 + 3x_2 + 1x_3 + 1x_4}{7} = \frac{2 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 6}{7} = \frac{16}{7}
            </me>.
            Note particularly that we divide by the <em>total weight</em>
            of the books, not the total number.

            Write a couple of sentences to explain how adjusting the location of one of the books or the weight of one of the books affects the location of the balancing point of the shelf.
            Think carefully here about how your changes should be considered relative to the location of the balancing point

            If we have an existing arrangement and balancing point,
            moving one of the locations to the left will move the balancing point to the left;
            similarly,
            moving one of the locations to the right will move the balancing point to the right.
            If instead we add weight to an existing location,
            if that location is left of the balancing point,
            the balancing point will move left;
            the behavior is similar if on the right.
