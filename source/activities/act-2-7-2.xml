      <introduction>
        <p>
      Consider the curve defined by the equation <m>y(y^2-1)(y-2) = x(x-1)(x-2)</m>,
      whose graph is pictured in the following figure.
        </p>
        <image width="40%" source="images/2_7_Act2"/>
        <p>
      Through implicit differentiation, it can be shown that
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(x-1)(x-2) + x(x-2) + x(x-1)}{(y^2-1)(y-2) + 2y^2(y-2) + y(y^2-1)}
      </me>.
      Use this fact to answer each of the following questions.
