      Consider the following situations in which a varying force accomplishes work.

      <statement>
        <p>
            Suppose that a heavy rope hangs over the side of a cliff.
            The rope is 200 feet long and weighs 0.3 pounds per foot;
            initially the rope is fully extended.
            How much work is required to haul in the entire length of the rope? (Hint:
            set up a function <m>F(h)</m> whose value is the weight of the rope remaining over the cliff after <m>h</m> feet have been hauled in.)
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
            Find a linear function <m>B(h)</m> that satisfies
            <m>B(0) = 200 \cdot 0.3</m> and <m>B(1) = 199 \cdot 0.3</m></p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p><m>W = \int_0^{200} 0.3(200-h) \, dh = 6000 \text{ foot-pounds}</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            When the full rope is extended over the cliff,
            the weight of the hanging rope is 200 pounds.
            Every foot of rope weighs 0.3 pounds;
            in addition,
            the quantity <m>(200-h)</m> measures the number of feet of rope hanging over the cliff when <m>h</m> feet of rope have been pulled in.
            This means that the function <m>F(h)</m> whose value is the weight of the rope hanging over the cliff after <m>h</m> feet have been pulled in is given by <m>F(h) = 0.3(200-h)</m>.
            When a small amount of rope, <m>\Delta h</m>,
            is pulled in, the work to move that slice of rope is given by
            <me>
              W_{\text{slice}} = F(h) \Delta h = 0.3(200-h) \Delta h
            </me>.
            Thus, the total work to pull in the 200 feet of rope is given by
            <me>
              W = \int_0^{200} 0.3(200-h) \, dh = 6000 \text{ foot-pounds}

        <p>
            A leaky bucket is being hauled up from a 100 foot deep well.
            When lifted from the water,
            the bucket and water together weigh 40 pounds.
            As the bucket is being hauled upward at a constant rate,
            the bucket leaks water at a constant rate so that it is losing weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot.
            What function <m>B(h)</m> tells the weight of the bucket after the bucket has been lifted <m>h</m> feet?
            What is the total amount of work accomplished in lifting the bucket to the top of the well?
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
            The weight of the bucket is given by a linear function.
          </p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p><m>W = \int_0^{100} (40-0.1h) \, dh = 3500 \text{foot-pounds}</m>.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Since <m>B(h)</m> changes at a constant rate,
            <m>B</m> is a linear function.
            We know that <m>B(0) = 40</m> and that <m>B</m> loses weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot of rope hauled in.
            Thus, <m>B(h) = 40 - 0.1h</m>.
            It follows that the total work to life the leaky bucket 100 feet is
            <me>
              W = int_0^{100} (40-0.1h) \, dh = 3500 \text{foot-pounds}

            Now suppose that the bucket in (b) does not leak at a constant rate,
            but rather that its weight at a height <m>h</m> feet above the water is given by <m>B(h) = 25 + 15e^{-0.05h}</m>.
            What is the total work required to lift the bucket 100 feet?
            What is the average force exerted on the bucket on the interval <m>h = 0</m> to <m>h = 100</m>?

            Recall that work is given by a certain definite integral.

      <answer>
        <p><m>B_{\text{AVG} [0,100]} \approx 25.9798 \text{ pounds}</m>.

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Given that <m>B(h) = 25 + 15e^{-0.05h}</m> is the weight of the bucket when <m>h</m> feet of rope have been pulled in,
            it follows that the total work to move the bucket 100 feet is

              W = \int_0^{100} (25 + 5e^{-0.05h})\, dh \approx 2597.98 \text{ foot-pounds}
            </me>.
            In addition,
            the average force that was exerted on the bucket is precisely the average weight of the bucket, which is
            <me>
              B_{\text{AVG} [0,100]} = \frac{1}{100-0} \int_0^{100} (25 + 5e^{-0.05h})\, dh \approx 25.9798 \text{ pounds}

            From physics, <em>Hooke's Law</em><idx><h>Hooke's Law</h></idx>
            for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed
            (or extended)
            to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed
            (or extended)
            from its natural length.
            That is, the force to compress
            (or extend)
            a spring <m>x</m> units from its natural length is
            <m>F(x) = kx</m> for some constant <m>k</m>
            (which is called the <em>spring constant</em>.)
            For springs,
            we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet.
            Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1/3 foot) beyond its natural length.

        <p>
            Now considering the given spring,

            <ol marker="i."><li><p>
                  Since <m>F(1/3) = 5</m> and <m>F(x) = kx</m> by Hoooke's Law,
