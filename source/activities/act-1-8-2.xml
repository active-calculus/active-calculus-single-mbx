      This activity concerns a function <m>f(x)</m> about which the following information is known:

      <ul><li><p><m>f</m> is a differentiable function defined at every real number <m>x</m></p></li><li><p><m>f(2) = -1</m></p></li><li><p><m>y = f'(x)</m> has its graph given in <xref ref="F-1-8-Act2">Figure</xref></p></li></ul></p>

        <caption>At center, a graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>; at left, axes for plotting <m>y = f(x)</m>; at right, axes for plotting <m>y = f''(x)</m>.</caption>

            Since <m>f(2) = -1</m> and <m>f'(2) = 2</m>,

            Neither.

        <p>
            The slope of the tangent line to
            <m>y = f(x)</m> is increasing for <m>x \lt 2</m> because
            <m>y = f'(x)</m> is an increasing function on this interval.
            Similarly, for <m>x &gt; 2</m>,
            the slope of the tangent line to <m>y = f(x)</m> is decreasing.
            Right at <m>x = 2</m>,
            the slope of the tangent line to
            <m>y = f(x)</m> is neither increasing nor decreasing.

            See the image below, which shows, at left,
            a possible graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> near <m>x = 2</m>,
            along with the tangent line

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            See the plot in the image below, which shows, at left,
            a possible graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> near <m>x = 2</m>,
            along with the tangent line
            <m>y = L(x)</m> through <m>(2, f(2))</m>.

            Note that <m>y = f(x)</m> is concave up for <m>x \lt 2</m> since <m>f'</m> is increasing on that interval,
            and <m>y = f(x)</m> is concave down for <m>x &gt; 2</m> since <m>f'</m> is decreasing there.
            Hence <m>y = f(x)</m> changes from concave up to concave down right at <m>x = 2</m>,
            which is also the point near 2 where the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> is steepest.

            Does your estimate in (b) over- or under-estimate the true value of <m>f(2.07)</m>?

            Does the tangent line lie above or below the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> at <m>(2,3)</m>?
          </p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p>
            Too large.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Because the tangent line to
            <m>y = f(x)</m> lies above the graph  of <m>f</m> to the right of <m>x = 2</m>,
            our estimate of <m>f(2.07)</m> is too large <mdash/> the local linearization overshoots the true value of <m>f</m> at this point.
