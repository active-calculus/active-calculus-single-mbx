            Recall our earlier work with limits involving infinity in <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref>.

            Given that an infinite sequence of real numbers is a function from the integers to the real numbers,
            apply the idea from part (a) to explain what you think it means for a sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> to have a limit as <m>n \to \infty</m>.

            If so, what is the limit?

            As <m>n</m> gets large,
            the constant terms become infinitesimally small compared to <m>n</m> and so <m>\frac{1+n}{2+n}</m> looks like
            <m>\frac{n}{n}</m> or 1 for large <m>n</m>.
            So the sequence <m>\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}</m> has a limit of 1 at infinity.
