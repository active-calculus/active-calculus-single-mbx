            The exact solution to the initial value problem
            <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t-1, \ y(0) = 0</m> is <m>y = t^2 - t</m>,
            which we find by integrating both sides with respect to <m>t</m> and then applying the fact that
            <m>y(0) = 0</m> to determine that the integration constant is <m>0</m>.
            From here, we can see that the errors are <m>e_1 = y(0.2) - y_1 = 0.04</m>,
            <m>e_2 = y(0.4) - y_2 = 0.08</m>,

            Explain why the value <m>y_5</m> generated by Euler's method for this initial value problem produces the same value as a left Riemann sum for the definite integral <m>\int_0^1 (2t-1)~dt</m>.

            If we first think about how <m>y_1</m> is generated for the initial value problem <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t) = 2t-1, \ y(0) = 0</m>,
            we see that <m>y_1 = y_0 + \Delta t \cdot f(t_0)</m>.
            Since <m>y_0 = 0</m>, we have <m>y_1 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0)</m>.
            From there, we know that <m>y_2</m> is given by <m>y_2 = y_1 + \Delta t f(t_1)</m>.
            Substituting our earlier result for <m>y_1</m>,
            we see that <m>y_2 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0) + \Delta t f(t_1)</m>.
            Continuing this process up to <m>y_5</m>, we get
            <me>
              y_5 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0) + \Delta t f(t_1) + \Delta t f(t_2) + \Delta t f(t_3) + \Delta t f(t_4)

            This is precisely the left Riemann sum with five subintervals for the definite integral <m>\int_0^1 (2t-1)~dt</m>.

        <p>
            How would your computations differ if the initial value was <m>y(0) = 1</m>?
            What does this mean about different solutions to this differential equation?
          </p>
      </statement>

      <answer>
        <p>
            Solutions to this differential equation all differ by only a constant.
          </p>
      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Since <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t-1</m>,
            the slope of the tangent line depends only on <m>t</m>.
            Thus, the different initial condition of
            <m>y(0) = 1</m> simply adds <m>1</m> to every value of <m>y_i</m> in our computations,
            which shifts every point we compute by Euler's Method up by 1 unit.
            This tells us that the solutions to this differential equation all differ by only a constant.
            We can see that both in our computations with Euler's Method and if we solve the differential equation to get <m>y = t^2 - t + C</m>.
