      <p>
      A potato is placed in an oven,
      and the potato's temperature <m>F</m>
      (in degrees Fahrenheit)
      at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table.
      Time <m>t</m> is measured in minutes.
      In <xref ref="act-1-5-1">Activity</xref>,
      we computed approximations to <m>F'(30)</m> and <m>F'(60)</m> using central differences.
      Those values are provided in the second table below,
      along with several others computed in the same way.

            At the moment <m>t = 30</m>,
            the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees;
            its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute;
            and the rate at which the temperature is rising is <em>falling</em>
            at a rate of 0.119 degrees per minute per minute.

            The value <m>F''(30) \approx -0.119</m>,
            which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us,
            along with the other data,
            that at the moment <m>t = 30</m>,
            the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees,
            that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute,

            at a rate of 0.119 degrees per minute per minute.
            That is, while the temperature is rising,
            it is rising at a slower and slower rate.
            At <m>t = 31</m>,
            we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.

      <solution>
        <p>
            The potato's temperature increasing at a decreasing rate because the values of the first derivative of <m>F</m> are falling.
            Equivalently,
            this is because the value of <m>F''(t)</m> is negative throughout the given time interval.
