        <p>
      A television camera is positioned 4000 feet from the base of a rocket launching pad.
      The angle of elevation of the camera has to change at the correct rate in order to keep the rocket in sight.
      In addition,
      the auto-focus of the camera has to take into account the increasing distance between the camera and the rocket.
      We assume that the rocket rises vertically. (A similar problem is discussed and <url href="https://gvsu.edu/s/9t" visual="gvsu.edu/s/9t">pictured dynamically</url>.
      Exploring the applet at the link will be helpful to you in answering the questions that follow.)

            To relate <m>z</m> and <m>h</m>,
            the Pythagorean Theorem is natural to consider.
            By this famous result,

              h^2 + 4000^2 = z^2

            Differentiating both sides implicitly with respect to <m>t</m>,
            it follows

        <hint>
          <p>
            Use the facts that <m>h = 3000</m> and
            <m>\frac{dh}{dt} = 600</m> in your preceding work.

          <p><m> \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = 360 \ \text{feet/sec}; </m><m> \left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{12}{125} </m> radians per second.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Using the given fact that the rocket's speed is 600 ft/sec at the instant it has risen 3000 feet,
            we know that <m>\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = 600</m>.
            Note further in the triangle that when <m>h = 3000</m>,
            it follows <m>z = 5000</m>,
            since the base leg of the triangle is constant at 4000,
            by using the Pythagorean Theorem.
            Substituting this information from the instant
            <m>h = 3000</m> into the equation that relates the rates of change of <m>z</m> and <m>h</m> found in (c),
            we find that
            <me>
              2 \cdot 3000 \cdot 600 = 2 \cdot 5000 \cdot \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}
            </me>.
            Solving for <m>\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}</m> we have
            <me>
              \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \ \text{feet/sec}
            </me>.
            To answer the question about how fast the camera angle is changing,
            we use the same information but now in the equation we found in (b) that relates the rates of change of <m>\theta</m> and <m>h</m>:
            <me>
              \frac{dh}{dt} = 4000 \sec^2 (\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt}
            </me>.
            Observe that when <m>h = 3000</m>,
            in the 3000-4000-5000 right triangle,
            it follows that <m>\cos(\theta) = \frac{4}{5}</m>,
            so <m>\sec(\theta) = \frac{5}{4}</m>.
            Thus, using the instantaneous information,
            <me>
              600 = 4000 \cdot \frac{25}{16} \left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}
            </me>,
            and thus
            <me>
              \left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{6 \cdot 16}{40 \cdot 25} = \frac{12}{125}
            </me>,
            which is measured in radians per second.

            If from an elevation of 3000 feet onward the rocket continues to rise at 600 feet/sec,
            will the rate of change of distance with respect to time be greater when the elevation is 4000 feet than it was at 3000 feet, or less?

            You can answer this question intuitively or by changing the value of <m>h</m> in your work in (d).

            greater.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Recalling that <m>2h \frac{dh}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}</m>,
            it follows that
            <me>
              \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{z} \frac{dh}{dt}
            </me>.
            Using this equation when <m>h = 3000</m> and
            <m>\frac{dh}{dt} = 600</m> led us to conclude that <m>\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{3}{5} \cdot 600 = 360 \ \text{feet/sec}</m>.
            If we instead use <m>h = 4000</m>,
            it follows that <m>z = 4000\sqrt{2}</m>, so that
            <me>
              \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=4000} = \frac{4}{4\sqrt{2}} \cdot 600 \approx 424.26 \ \text{feet/sec}
            </me>.
            Indeed,
            <m>\frac{dz}{dt}</m> is an increasing function of <m>h</m>,
            provided that <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> is constant,
            because we can write <m>h^2 + 4000^2 = z^2</m>,
            so <m>z = \sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}</m>, making
            <me>
              \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} 600
            </me>.
            It is straightforward to verify that
            <m>\frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}}</m> is an increasing function of <m>h</m>.
