            It appears that as we increase the order of the Taylor polynomials,
            they fit the graph of <m>f</m> better and better over larger intervals.

            The graphs of the 10th (magenta), 20th (blue),
            and 30th (green) Taylor polynomials centered at <m>0</m> for <m>e^x</m> are shown below along with the graph of <m>f(x)</m> in red:
