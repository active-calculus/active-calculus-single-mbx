            To find the Taylor series for <m>g(x) = x^3 \sin(x^2)</m>, we start with <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> and view <m>g(x) = x^3 f(x^2)</m>.  Thus, since 
            <me>
              f(x) = \sin(x) = x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \cdots
            </me>
            we have 
            <me>
              f(x^2) = x^2 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \frac{1}{5!}x^{10} - \cdots
            </me>
            and thus
            <me>
              g(x) = x^3 \sin(x^2) = x^5 - \frac{1}{3!}x^9 + \frac{1}{5!}x^{13} - \cdots
            </me>.
            We expect this series to converge for all <m>x</m> since the original series for <m>\sin(x)</m> converges for every <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For <m>h(x) = e^{-x^4}</m>, we start with the series for <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and then substitute <m>-x^2</m> for <m>x</m>.  Doing so,
            <me>
              f(x) = e^x = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \cdots
            </me>
            and thus
            <me>
              h(x) = g(-x^4) = 1 - x^4 + \frac{1}{2!}x^8 - \frac{1}{3!}x^{12} + \cdots
            </me>.
            Since the series for <m>e^x</m> converges for all real numbers <m>x</m>, the same will be true when we replace <m>x</m> with <m>-x^2</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>p(x) = \frac{1}{1+5x}</m> has the same structure as <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>, we start with the series for <m>f(x)</m>, which converges for <m>-1 \lt x \lt 1</m>.  We will then replace <m>x</m> with <m>-5x</m> since <m>p(x) = f(-5x)</m>.  In particular, since
            <me>
              f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots
            </me>,
            we have
            <me>
              p(x) = f(-5x) = 1 - 5x + (-5x)^2 + (-5x)^3 + \cdots = 1 - 5x + 5^2x^2 - 5^3x^3 + \cdots
            </me>
            The series for <m>p(x)</m> is geometric with <m>a = 1</m> and <m>r = -5x</m>, so it converges whenever <m>|-5x| \lt 1</m>, so for all <m>x</m> such that <m>-\frac{1}{5} \lt x \lt \frac{1}{5}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For <m>q(x) = x^2 \ln(1+x^4)</m>, we start with the series for <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> and replace <m>x</m> by <m>x^4</m>.  In particular, since
            <me>
              f(x) = \ln(1+x) = x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \cdots
            </me>
            we have
            <me>
               f(x^4) = x^4 - \frac{1}{2}x^8 + \frac{1}{3}x^{12} - \cdots
            </me>
            and thus
            <me>
              q(x) = x^2 f(x^4) = x^6 - \frac{1}{2}x^{10} + \frac{1}{3}x^{14} - \cdots
            </me>.
            For the series for <m>f(x^4)</m> to converge, we need <m>|x^4| \lt 1</m> since the original series for <m>f(x)</m> converges for <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.  Note that <m>|x^4| \lt 1</m> precisely when <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.  Multiplying by <m>x^2</m> does not affect the values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges.
