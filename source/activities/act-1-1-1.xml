            About 6.4 feet per second.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Observe that the average velocity of the ball on the intervals <m>[0.799,0.8]</m> and
            <m>[0.8,0.801]</m> is 6.416 and 6.384 feet/sec respectively.
            Hence it appears that the ball's velocity at the instant <m>t = 0.8</m> should be about 6.4 feet per second.
