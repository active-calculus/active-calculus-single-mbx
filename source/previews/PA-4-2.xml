  <statement>
    <p>
    A person walking along a straight path has her velocity in miles per hour at time <m>t</m> given by the function <m>v(t) = 0.25t^3-1.5t^2+3t+0.25</m>,
    for times in the interval <m>0 \le t \le 2</m>.
    The graph of this function is also given in each of the three diagrams in <xref ref="F-4-2-PA1">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
    <figure xml:id="F-4-2-PA1">
      <caption>Three approaches to estimating the area under <m>y = v(t)</m> on the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="97%" source="images/4_2_PA1"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
    Note that in each diagram,
    we use four rectangles to estimate the area under
    <m>y = v(t)</m> on the interval <m>[0,2]</m>,
    but the method by which the four rectangles' respective heights are decided varies among the three individual graphs.

    <ol marker="a."><li><p>
          How are the heights of rectangles in the left-most diagram being chosen?
          Explain, and hence determine the value of
          <me>
            S = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4
          </me>
          by evaluating the function
          <m>y = v(t)</m> at appropriately chosen values and observing the width of each rectangle.
          Note, for example, that
          <me>
            A_3 = v(1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1
          </me>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Explain how the heights of rectangles are being chosen in the middle diagram and find the value of
          <me>
            T = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4
          </me>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Likewise,
          determine the pattern of how heights of rectangles are chosen in the right-most diagram and determine
          <me>
            U = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4
          </me>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Of the estimates <m>S</m>, <m>T</m>, and <m>U</m>,
          which do you think is the best approximation of <m>D</m>,
          the total distance the person traveled on <m>[0,2]</m>?
          Why?
