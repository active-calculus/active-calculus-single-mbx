    Consider the initial value problem given by 
    <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = y, \ y(0) = 1</me>.

          To begin, let's assume that <m>y</m> is a function with a power series representation that is centered at <m>a = 0</m>, so we can write
          <men xml:id="EQ-PA-8a-6-1">
            y = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4 x^4 \cdots + c_n x^n + \cdots
          </men>.
          Use the Power Series Differentiation Theorem to differentiate the right side of <xref ref="EQ-PA-8a-6-1">Equation</xref>.  Thus, express <m>y'</m> as a power series; show at least the first four terms of that series.
        </p>

          An important fact about polynomials is: the only way that two polynomials can be equal to one another is if they have the exact same coefficients for each shared power of <m>x</m>.  For example, if we knew that <m>a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 = 3 - 2x + 5x^2</m>, then it follows that <m>a_0 = 3</m>, <m>a_1 = -2</m>, and <m>a_2 = 5</m>.
        </p>  
        <p>
          This fact about polynomials extends to power series.
