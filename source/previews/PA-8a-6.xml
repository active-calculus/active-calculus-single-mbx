    Consider the initial value problem given by 
    <me>y' = y, \ y(0) = 1</me>.
  </p>

          To begin, let's assume that <m>y</m> is a function with a power series representation that is centered at <m>a = 0</m>, so we can write
          <men xml:id="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y">
            y = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4 x^4 + \cdots + c_n x^n + \cdots
          </men>.
          Use the <xref ref="T-PS-diff-int">Power Series Differentiation Theorem</xref> to differentiate the right side of <xref ref="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y">Equation</xref>.  Thus, express <m>y'</m> as a power series; show at least the first four nonzero terms of that series.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          An important fact about polynomials is that the only way two polynomials can be equal to one another is if they have the exact same coefficients for each power of <m>x</m>.  For example, if we know that <m>a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 = 3 - 2x + 5x^2</m>, then it follows that <m>a_0 = 3</m>, <m>a_1 = -2</m>, and <m>a_2 = 5</m>.
        </p>  
        <p>
          This fact about polynomials extends to power series: the only way that two power series can be equal is for them to have identical coefficients.  In (a), you found that <m>y' = c_1 + 2c_2 x + 3c_3 x^2 + 4c_4 x^3 + \cdots + nc_n x^{n-1} + \cdots</m>.  Using the power series representation of <m>y</m> found in <xref ref="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y">Equation</xref>, together with the condition from the initial value problem that <m>y' = y</m>, it follows that 
          <men xml:id="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y-yprime">
              c_1 + 2c_2 x + 3c_3 x^2 + \cdots = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \cdots
          </men>
          What does <xref ref="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y-yprime">Equation</xref> imply about the relationship between <m>c_0</m> and <m>c_1</m>?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Note that the initial value problem statement tells us that <m>y(0) = 1</m>.  Using <xref ref="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y">Equation</xref> determine the value of <m>c_0</m>, and hence find the value of <m>c_1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>    
      <li>
        <p>
          Now return to <xref ref="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y-yprime">Equation</xref>.  What can we conclude about the relationship between <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> based on the <q><m>x</m></q> terms on each side of the equation?  Using this relationship and the value you found for <m>c_1</m> in (c), determine the numerical value of <m>c_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Finally, reason similarly to find <m>c_3</m>, <m>c_4</m>, and <m>c_5</m> by equating the coefficients of <m>x^2</m>, <m>x^3</m>, and <m>x^4</m>, respectively, in <xref ref="EQ-PA-8a-6-1-y-yprime">Equation</xref>.  What do you find?  Why is this result not surprising?
