      <introduction>
        <p>
    A student with a third floor dormitory window 32 feet off the ground tosses a water balloon straight up in the air with an initial velocity of 16 feet per second.
    It turns out that the instantaneous velocity of the water balloon is given by <m>v(t) = -32t + 16</m>,
    where <m>v</m> is measured in feet per second and <m>t</m> is measured in seconds.

        <statement>
          <p>
          Let <m>s(t)</m> represent the height of the water balloon above ground at time <m>t</m>,
          and note that <m>s</m> is an antiderivative of <m>v</m>.
          That is,
          <m>v</m> is the derivative of <m>s</m>: <m>s'(t) = v(t)</m>.
          Find a formula for <m>s(t)</m> that satisfies the initial condition that the balloon is tossed from 32 feet above ground.
          In other words,
          make your formula for <m>s</m> satisfy <m>s(0) = 32</m>.

          Sketch a graph of the velocity function

          What is the total net signed area bounded by
          <m>y = v(t)</m> and the <m>t</m>-axis on <m>[0,2]</m>?
          Answer this question in two ways:
          first by using your work above,
          and then by using a familiar geometric formula to compute areas of certain relevant regions.
