      showed how we can approximate the number <m>e</m> with linear,
      quadratic,
      and other polynomial approximations.
      We use a similar approach in this activity to obtain linear and quadratic approximations to <m>\ln(2)</m>.
      Along the way,
      we encounter a type of series that is different than most of the ones we have seen so far.
      Throughout this activity, let <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Find the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>x=0</m> and use this linearization to approximate <m>\ln(2)</m>.
            That is, find <m>L(x)</m>,
            the tangent line approximation to <m>f(x)</m>,
            and use the fact that
            <m>L(1) \approx f(1)</m> to estimate <m>\ln(2)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The linearization of <m>\ln(1+x)</m> does not provide a very good approximation to <m>\ln(2)</m> since <m>1</m> is not that close to <m>0</m>.
            To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach;
            instead of using a straight line to approximate <m>\ln(2)</m>,
            we use a quadratic function to account for the concavity of
            <m>\ln(1+x)</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>0</m>.
            With the linearization,
            both the function's value and slope agree with the linearization's value and slope at <m>x=0</m>.
            We will now make a quadratic approximation <m>P_2(x)</m> to
            <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> centered at <m>x=0</m> with the property that <m>P_2(0) = f(0)</m>,
            <m>P'_2(0) = f'(0)</m>, and <m>P''_2(0) = f''(0)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol marker="i.">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Let <m>P_2(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2}</m>.
                  Show that <m>P_2(0) = f(0)</m>,
                  <m>P'_2(0) = f'(0)</m>,
                  and <m>P''_2(0) = f''(0)</m>.
                  Use <m>P_2(x)</m> to approximate <m>\ln(2)</m> by using the fact that <m>P_2(1) \approx f(1)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  We can continue approximating <m>\ln(2)</m> with polynomials of larger degree whose derivatives agree with those of <m>f</m> at <m>0</m>.
                  This makes the polynomials fit the graph of <m>f</m> better for more values of <m>x</m> around <m>0</m>.
                  For example,
                  let <m>P_3(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}</m>.
                  Show that <m>P_3(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>P'_3(0) = f'(0)</m>,
                  <m>P''_3(0) = f''(0)</m>,
                  and <m>P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)</m>.
                  Taking a similar approach to preceding questions,
                  use <m>P_3(x)</m> to approximate <m>\ln(2)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If we used a degree <m>4</m> or degree <m>5</m> polynomial to approximate <m>\ln(1+x)</m>,
                  what approximations of <m>\ln(2)</m> do you think would result?
                  Use the preceding questions to conjecture a pattern that holds,
                  and state the degree <m>4</m> and degree <m>5</m> approximation.
