    Suppose that the following information is known about a function <m>f</m>:
    the graph of its derivative,
    <m>y = f'(x)</m>, is given in <xref ref="F-5-1-PA1">Figure</xref>.
    Further, assume that <m>f'</m> is piecewise linear
    (as pictured)
    and that for <m>x \le 0</m> and <m>x \ge 6</m>, <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
    Finally, it is given that <m>f(0) = 1</m>.
