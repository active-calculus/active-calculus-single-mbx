      <introduction>
        <p>
    Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity,
    a differential equation naturally arises.
    In the following two problems,
    we see two such scenarios;
    for each, we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest.

          Now consider a different scenario.  Suppose that a water tank holds 100 gallons and that a salty
          solution,
          which contains 20 grams of salt in every gallon,
          enters the
          tank at 2 gallons per minute.
