      <introduction>
        <p>
    Suppose you receive <m>\dollar5000</m> through an inheritance.
    You decide to invest this money into a fund that pays <m>8\%</m> annually,
    compounded monthly.
    That means that each month your investment earns <m>\frac{0.08}{12} \cdot P</m> additional dollars,
    where <m>P</m> is your principal balance at the start of the month.
    So in the first month your investment earns
    <me>
      5000 \left(\frac{0.08}{12}\right)
    </me>
    or <m>\dollar33.33</m>.
    If you reinvest this money,
    you will then have <m>\dollar5033.33</m> in your account at the end of the first month.
    From this point on,
    assume that you reinvest all of the interest you earn.
  </p>

          Use this formula to check your calculations in <xref ref="T-PA-8-1-Interest">Table</xref>.
