        <p>
    A function <m>f</m> is given by the graph in the following figure.
    Use the graph to answer each of the following questions.
    Note: to the right of <m>x = 2</m>,
    the graph of <m>f</m> is exhibiting infinite oscillatory behavior similar to the function
    <m>\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})</m> that we encountered in the key example early in <xref ref="sec-1-2-lim">Section</xref>.  Assume that <m>f(2) = -2.5</m>.

          determine whether or not <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m> exists.
          If the function has a limit <m>L</m> at a given point,
          state the value of the limit using the notation <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</m>.
          If the function does not have a limit at a given point,
          write a sentence to explain why.

          In particular, based on the given graph,
          ask yourself if it is reasonable to say that <m>f</m> has a tangent line at
          <m>(a,f(a))</m> for each of the given <m>a</m>-values.
          If so,
          visually estimate the slope of the tangent line to find the value of <m>f'(a)</m>.
