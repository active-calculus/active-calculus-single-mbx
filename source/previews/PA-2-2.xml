          Write at least one sentence that explains why it is reasonable to think that <m>g'(x) = cg(x)</m>,
          where <m>c</m> is a constant.
          In addition, calculate <m>\ln(2)</m>,
          and then discuss how this value,
          combined with your work above,
          reasonably suggests that <m>g'(x) = 2^x \ln(2)</m>.
