        <p>
          We know the coefficients of the Taylor series for <m>g(x)</m> centered at <m>a=0</m> are
          given by <m>\frac{g^{(k)}(0)}{k!}</m>, so we start calculating some derivatives.  Note
          that we can write <m>g(x)=(1+x^2)^{-1}</m>. Calculate <m>g'(x)</m>, and <m>g''(x)</m>.

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          We use chain rule to calculate that the derivative of <m>g(x) = (1 + x^2)^{-1}</m> is
          <m>g'(x) = -2x\left(1+x62\right)^{-2}</m>, and then depending on how we write it,
          we either use product and chain rule, or quotient and chain rule to calculate that
          <m>g''(x) = 2\left(3x^2 - 1\right)\left(1 + x^2\right)^{-3}</m>.

          If you simplify <m>g''(x)</m>, take the derivative again, and simplify the result, you'd

            g'''(x) = \frac{24x - 24x^3}{(1+x^2)^4}

          This gets messy quickly, and even simplifying before taking another derivative or two
          would still use power, chain, and quotient rules, as well as constant multiple and sum or
          difference.

        <p>
          Since the derivatives of <m>g</m> become so complicated, we consider a different approach
          to finding the Taylor series centered at <m>a=0</m> for <m>g(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m>. We
          take advantage of the fact that <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}</m> has a Taylor series expansion we
          already know, and observe that <m>f</m> has an algebraic structure similar to <m>g</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We introduce a new variable, <m>u</m>, and recall that
          <me>
            f(u) = \dfrac{1}{1 - u} = 1 + u + u^2 + u^3 + \cdots + u^n + \cdots
          </me>
          for <m>\lvert u\rvert \lt 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>u=-x^2</m>. What equation results from evaluating <m>f(-x^2)</m> in the equation
          given above for <m>f(u)</m>?
        </p>
        <instruction>Enter the first 4 nonzero terms in the sum on the right-hand-side of the resulting equation.</instruction>
        <p>
          <m>f\mathopen{}\left(-x^2\right)\mathclose{} = \frac{1}{1-\left(-x^2\right)} = {}</m><var name="'1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6'" width="30"/><m>{} + \cdots</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          How does the answer here compare to the formula you found for <m>T_3(x)</m> in (c)?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          If we substitute <m>-x^2</m> in for the <m>u</m>, then we get
          <me>
            f\mathopen{}\left(-x^2\right)\mathclose{} = \frac{1}{1 - \left(-x^2\right)} = 1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6 + \cdots + \left(-x^2\right)^n + \cdots
          </me>
          The first two nonzero terms agree with our earlier calculation of <m>T_3(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </solution> -->
    </task>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Note that <m>1 - \left(-x^2\right) = 1 + x^2</m>, so we just found an infinite series
          representation for <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}</m> without calculating derivatives of
          <m>g(x)</m>, by using the series we had already calculated for
          <m>f(u) = \frac{1}{1 - u}</m>. For what values of <m>x</m> do you expect this series for
          <m>g(x)</m> will converge?
        </p>
        <instruction>Use interval notation.</instruction>
        <p>
          <var name="Interval(-1,1)" width="10"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hint</em>: Think about what you know about the values of <m>u</m> for which the series for
          <m>f(u)</m> will converge.
        </p>

      </hint>

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          Since the Taylor series for <m>f(u)</m> converged when <m>\lvert u\rvert \lt 1</m> and
          all we did was substitute <m>-x^2</m> for the <m>u</m>, we expect our new series to
          converge when <m>\left\lvert-x^2\right\rvert \lt 1</m>, which is when
          <m>\lvert x\rvert \lt 1</m>, or in interval notation, <m>(-1,1)</m>.
