    Let 
    <me>
      g(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ol marker="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          Note that we can write <m>g(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1}</m>.  Determine <m>g'(x)</m>, <m>g''(x)</m>, and <m>g'''(x)</m>.

          In (a), you found that 
          <me>
            g'''(x) = \frac{24x - 24x^3}{(1+x^2)^4}
          </me>.
          What derivative rules would be needed to find <m>g^{(4)}(x)</m>?

      <li>
        <p>
          Find <m>g(0)</m>, <m>g'(0)</m>, <m>g''(0)</m>, and <m>g'''(0)</m>, and use the results to determine <m>T_3(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Since the derivatives of <m>g</m> become so complicated, we consider a different approach to finding the Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}</m>.  We take advantage of the fact that <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> has a Taylor series expansion we already know, and observe that <m>f</m> has an algebraic structure similar to <m>g</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We introduce a new variable, <m>u</m>, and recall that
          <men xml:id="eq-PA-8a-5-geom-sub">
            f(u) = \frac{1}{1-u} = 1 + u + u^2 + u^3 + \cdots + u^n + \cdots
          </men>
          for <m>|u| \lt 1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>u = -x^2</m>.  What equation results from evaluating <m>f(-x^2)</m> in <xref ref="eq-PA-8a-5-geom-sub">Equation</xref>?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          How does our work in (d) compare to the formula you found for <m>P_3(x)</m> and suggest the Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}</m>?  For what values of <m>x</m> do you expect this series will converge?  Why?
