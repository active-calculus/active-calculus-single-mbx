      <introduction>
        <p>
    The position of a car driving along a straight road at time <m>t</m> in minutes is given by the function
    <m>y = s(t)</m> whose graph is provided.
    The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet.
    For instance,
    the point <m>(2,4)</m> on the graph indicates that after 2 minutes,
    the car has traveled 4000 feet.

          In everyday language,
          describe the behavior of the car over the provided time interval.
          In particular,
          you should carefully discuss what is happening on each of the time intervals <m>[0,1]</m>,
          <m>[1,2]</m>, <m>[2,3]</m>,
          <m>[3,4]</m>, and <m>[4,5]</m>,
