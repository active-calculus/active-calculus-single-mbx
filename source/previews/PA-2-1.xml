    Functions of the form <m>f(x) = x^n</m>,
    where <m>n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots</m>,
    are often called <term>power functions</term>.
    The first two questions below revisit work we did earlier in <xref ref="C-1">Chapter</xref>,
    and the following questions extend those ideas to higher powers of <m>x</m>.

    <ol label="a." permid="urJ">
