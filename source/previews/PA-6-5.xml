  <statement>
    <p>
    A company with a large customer base has a call center that receives thousands of calls a day.
    After studying the data that represents how long callers wait for assistance,
    they find that the function
    <m>p(t) = 0.25e^{-0.25t}</m> models the time customers wait in the following way:
    the fraction of customers who wait between <m>t = a</m> and <m>t = b</m> minutes is given by
    <me>
      \int_a^b p(t) \, dt
    </me>.
  </p>
    <p>
    Use this information to answer the following questions.

    <ol marker="a."><li><p>
          Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 5 and 10 minutes.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 10 and 20 minutes.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Next, let's study the fraction who wait up to a certain number of minutes:

          <ol marker="i."><li><p>
                What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 5 minutes?
              </p></li><li><p>
                What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 10 minutes?
              </p></li><li><p>
                Between 0 and 15 minutes?
                Between 0 and 20?
              </p></li></ol></p></li><li><p>
          Let <m>F(b)</m> represent the fraction of callers who wait between <m>0</m> and <m>b</m> minutes.
          Find a formula for <m>F(b)</m> that involves a definite integral,
          and then use the First FTC to find a formula for <m>F(b)</m> that does not involve a definite integral.
        </p></li><li><p>
          What is the value of the limit <m>\lim_{b \to \infty} F(b)</m>?
          What is its meaning in the context of the problem?
        </p></li></ol></p>
