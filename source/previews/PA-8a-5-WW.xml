    <introduction>

        Let

      <statement>
        <p>
          We know the coefficients of the Taylor series for <m>g(x)</m> centered at <m>a=0</m> are
          given by <m>\frac{g^{(k)}(0)}{k!}</m>, so we start calculating some derivatives.  Note
          that we can write <m>g(x)=(1+x^2)^{-1}</m>. Calculate <m>g'(x)</m>, and <m>g''(x)</m>.

      </statement>

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          We use chain rule to calculate that the derivative of <m>g(x) = (1 + x^2)^{-1}</m> is
          <m>g'(x) = -2x\left(1+x62\right)^{-2}</m>, and then depending on how we write it,
          we either use product and chain rule, or quotient and chain rule to calculate that
          <m>g''(x) = 2\left(3x^2 - 1\right)\left(1 + x^2\right)^{-3}</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          If you simplify <m>g''(x)</m>, take the derivative again, and simplify the result, you'd
          find that
          <me>
            g'''(x) = \frac{24x - 24x^3}{(1+x^2)^4}
          </me>.
          If we don't rewrite <m>g'''(x)</m> from the form shown above, what derivative rules would
          be needed to calculate <m>g^{(4)}(x)</m>?  Select all that apply.

          This gets messy quickly, and even simplifying before taking another derivative or two
          would still use power, chain, and quotient rules, as well as constant multiple and sum or
          difference.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Since the derivatives of <m>g</m> become so complicated, we consider a different approach
          to finding the Taylor series centered at <m>a=0</m> for <m>g(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m>. We
          take advantage of the fact that <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}</m> has a Taylor series expansion we
          already know, and observe that <m>f</m> has an algebraic structure similar to <m>g</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We introduce a new variable, <m>u</m>, and recall that
          <me>
            f(u) = \dfrac{1}{1 - u} = 1 + u + u^2 + u^3 + \cdots + u^n + \cdots
          </me>
          for <m>\lvert u\rvert \lt 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>u=-x^2</m>. What equation results from evaluating <m>f(-x^2)</m> in the equation
          given above for <m>f(u)</m>?
        </p>
        <instruction>Enter the first 4 nonzero terms in the sum on the right-hand-side of the resulting equation.</instruction>
        <p>
          <m>f\mathopen{}\left(-x^2\right)\mathclose{} = \frac{1}{1-\left(-x^2\right)} = {}</m><var name="'1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6'" width="30"/><m>{} + \cdots</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          How does the answer here compare to the formula you found for <m>T_3(x)</m> in (c)?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          If we substitute <m>-x^2</m> in for the <m>u</m>, then we get
          <me>
            f\mathopen{}\left(-x^2\right)\mathclose{} = \frac{1}{1 - \left(-x^2\right)} = 1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6 + \cdots + \left(-x^2\right)^n + \cdots
          </me>
          The first two nonzero terms agree with our earlier calculation of <m>T_3(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </solution> -->
    </task>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Note that <m>1 - \left(-x^2\right) = 1 + x^2</m>, so we just found an infinite series
          representation for <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}</m> without calculating derivatives of
          <m>g(x)</m>, by using the series we had already calculated for
          <m>f(u) = \frac{1}{1 - u}</m>. For what values of <m>x</m> do you expect this series for
          <m>g(x)</m> will converge?
        </p>
        <instruction>Use interval notation.</instruction>
        <p>
          <var name="Interval(-1,1)" width="10"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hint</em>: Think about what you know about the values of <m>u</m> for which the series for
          <m>f(u)</m> will converge.
        </p>

      </hint>

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          Since the Taylor series for <m>f(u)</m> converged when <m>\lvert u\rvert \lt 1</m> and
          all we did was substitute <m>-x^2</m> for the <m>u</m>, we expect our new series to
          converge when <m>\left\lvert-x^2\right\rvert \lt 1</m>, which is when
          <m>\lvert x\rvert \lt 1</m>, or in interval notation, <m>(-1,1)</m>.
