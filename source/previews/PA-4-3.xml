    Consider this <url href="https://gvsu.edu/s/a9" visual="gvsu.edu/s/a9">applet</url>, in which
    you will initially see the situation shown in <xref ref="F-4-3-GGBApplet">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
      <figure xml:id="F-4-3-GGBApplet">
        <caption>A right Riemann sum with 10 subintervals for the function <m>f(x) = \sin(2x) - \frac{x^2}{10} + 3</m> on the interval <m>[1,7]</m>.  The value of the sum is <m>R_{10} = 4.90595</m>.</caption>
        <image width="100%" source="images/4_3_GGBApplet"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
    Note that the value of the chosen Riemann sum is displayed next to the word <q>relative,</q>
    and that you can change the type of Riemann sum being computed by dragging the point on the slider bar below the phrase
    <q>sample point placement.</q></p>
      <p>
    Explore to see how you can change the window in which the function is viewed,
    as well as the function itself.
    You can set the minimum and maximum values of <m>x</m> by clicking and dragging on the blue points that set the endpoints;
    you can change the function by typing a new formula in the
    <q>f(x)</q> window at the bottom;
    and you can adjust the overall window by
    <q>panning and zooming</q>
    by using the Shift key and the scrolling feature of your mouse.
    More information on how to pan and zoom 
    <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/Fl" visual="gvsu.edu/s/Fl">is available</url>.
  </p>
      <p>
    Work accordingly to adjust the applet so that it uses a left Riemann sum with <m>n = 5</m> subintervals for the function is <m>f(x) = 2x + 1</m>.
    You should see the updated figure shown in <xref ref="F-4-3-GGBApplet2">Figure</xref>.
    Then, answer the following questions.

        <p>
          Update the applet
          (and view window, as needed)
          so that the function being considered is
          <m>f(x) = 2x+1</m> on <m>[1,4]</m>, as directed above.
          For this function on this interval,
          compute <m>L_{n}</m>, <m>M_{n}</m>,
          <m>R_{n}</m> for <m>n = 5</m>,
          <m>n = 25</m>, and <m>n = 100</m>.
          What appears to be the exact area bounded by
