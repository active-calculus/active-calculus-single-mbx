              To find the equilibrium solutions,
              we first set <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 0</m>.
              Doing so, we find that

              making this equilibrium unstable.
              And this makes sense:  the population of mice will grow without bound,
              because one cat is insufficient to keep up with a mice population growing at a rate of <m>20</m> times its size per year.
