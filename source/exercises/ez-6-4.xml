              We now suppose that the resulting tank is filled to a depth of <m>1.5</m> feet with water weighing <m>62.4</m> pounds per cubic foot.
              Since the bottom of the tank is at <m>1.84527</m>,
              being full to a depth of <m>1.5</m> feet means that there is water from
              <m>x = 0.34527</m> to <m>x = 1.84527</m>.
              To find the work done to pump the water until <m>0.5</m> feet remain in the tank (i.e. to a level where <m>x = 1.34527</m>),
              we have to first find the weight of a typical slice,
              which requires us to know the volume of such a slice.
              Observe that for a slice at depth <m>x</m>,
              <me permid="Lfm">
                V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi \left( 3\cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \right)^2 \triangle x
              </me>.
              Since water weighs <m>62.4</m> pounds per cubic foot, the weight
              (and thus force to be exerted)
              of such a slice is
              <me permid="rmv">

              </me>.
              Finally, the work done to pump such a slice to the top of the tank requires the slice to move <m>x</m> units,
              and thus work for that slice is
              <me permid="XtE">
                W_{\text{slice}} \approx x \cdot 561.6 \pi \cos^2 \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \triangle x
              </me>.
              To find the total work accomplished,
              we use a definite integral to sum the work done on each slice from <m>x = 0.34527</m>
              (the top of the water when the tank is initially full to <m>1.84527</m> feet)
              to <m>x = 1.34527</m>
              (the height of the water after <m>1</m> foot has been emptied).
              Thus,
              <me permid="DAN">
                W = \int_{0.34527}^{1.34527}  561.6 \pi \cdot x \cos^2 \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \, dx
              </me>.
              Evaluating the integral, we find <m>W \approx 1353.55</m> foot-pounds.

              If instead we envision the tank not as a solid of revolution but as a trough,
              where the two-dimensional figure above forms one end of a tank that is 10 feet long,
              we now have a similar problem but with slices that are thin rectangular slabs,
              rather than thin cylindrical disks.
              Note that each such slice is <m>2 f(x)</m> wide, <m>10</m> feet long,
              and <m>\triangle x</m> thick.
              Thus, for a slice at depth <m>x</m>,

              Since water weighs <m>62.4</m> pounds per cubic foot, the weight
              (and thus force to be exerted)
              of such a slice is

              Finally, the work done to pump such a slice to the top of the tank requires the slice to move <m>x</m> units,
              and thus work for that slice is
              <me permid="vWo">

              Assuming that the tank is completely full,
              to lower the tank by <m>h</m> feet,
              we consider slices from <m>x = 0</m> to <m>x = h</m>,
              and thus using a definite integral to sum the work required for each slice,
              we find that the total work is

              First, we note that a typical slice at location <m>x</m> will be at a depth of <m>x</m> feet below the water and have area
              <me permid="IkG">

              At any point on this slice,

              Finally, since <m>F = P \cdot A</m>,

              First, we set up axes and a sketch for one of the ends of the cylindrical tank.
              It is simplest to let ground level correspond to the (horizontal) <m>y</m>-axis with the positive <m>x</m>-axis pointing straight down,
              so that <m>x = 0</m> corresponds to ground level and the value of <m>x</m> tells us the depth of a particular location.
              The circular end of the tank has radius <m>3</m> and is centered at the point <m>(5,0)</m> since its top is <m>2</m> feet underground.

              Finally, to empty half the tank,
              we need to consider slices from <m>x = 2</m> to <m>x = 5</m>,
              and thus using a definite integral to sum the work required for each slice, we get
              <me permid="lxj">
                W = \int_2^5 1248 (x+4.5) \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \, dx = 1404(19\pi - 8) \approx 72573.13

              To find the hydrostatic force due to water pressure that is exerted on one end of the tank by the remaining water,
              we first find the area of a rectangular slice at a location <m>x</m>, which is
              <me permid="REs">
                A_{\text{slice}} \approx 2 f(x) \triangle x = 2 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \triangle x
              </me>.
              We note that such a slice lies between <m>x = 5</m> and <m>x = 8</m>,
              which is the values of <m>x</m> that represent the depths of remaining water from top to bottom.
              At an <m>x</m> in this interval,
              the slice's depth below the surface of the water is <m>x - 5</m>.
              Thus, since pressure is weight-density times depth, it follows that
              <me permid="xLB">
                P_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 (x-5)
              </me>.
              Finally, since <m>F = P \cdot A</m>,
              the total force water is exerting on this slice is
              <me permid="dSK">
                F_{\text{slice}} = P_{\text{slice}} \cdot A_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 (x-5) \cdot 2 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2}  \triangle x
              </me>.
              Integrating to sum the total force, we find
