              in the account at time <m>t</m>.
              We know that the rate of change of <m>A</m> is affected by the addition of <m>1</m> million dollars a year,

              Note that <m>1 + 0.05A = 0.05(20 + A)</m>, so we have

              Solving for <m>t</m>, we find that <m>10e^{0.05t} = 20</m>,

              Let the skydiver's downward velocity at time <m>t</m> be given by <m>v(t)</m>.
              Since gravity causes her downward velocity to increase at the rate of <m>g\approx 9.8</m>,
              there is a factor of <m>+9.8</m> meters per second squared in the differential equation for <m>\frac{dv}{dt}</m>,
              while the factor of wind resistence causing the velocity to decrease contributes the negative factor <m>-kv</m>.
              Thus, the differential equation is

              Doing so, <m>0 = 9.8 - kv</m>,
              so <m>v = \frac{9.8}{k}</m>.
              Moreover, we note that for <m>v \lt \frac{9.8}{k}</m>,

              As <m>t \to \infty</m>, we know <m>e^{-\frac{3}{100}t} \to 0</m>,
              and thus <m>S(t) \to 2000</m>.
              This makes sense because the inflow carries <m>20</m> grams of salt per liter continuously.
              As time goes on,
              the concentration of solution in the tank should tend to that same concentration,
              and with <m>100</m> gallons of solution,
              the amount of salt will tend to <m>20 \cdot 100 = 2000</m> grams.
              This value also matches the stable equilibrium that we found in (f).
