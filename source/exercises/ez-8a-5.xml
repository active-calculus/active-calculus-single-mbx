    <statement>
      <p>
        In this exercise we find the Taylor series representation for two famous functions, the Fresnel integral functions
        <me>
          C(x) = \int_0^x \cos(t^2) \, dt
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          S(x) = \int_0^x \sin(t^2) \, dt
        </me>.
        The Fresnel integral functions are important in optics and are used in the design of Fresnel lenses such as those found in lighthouses along the Lake Michigan shore.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The fact that we can differentiate or integrate a Taylor series reveals other important ways we can think about functions such as <m>e^x</m>.
        </p>

        <ol marker="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Perhaps the most important property of the function <m>h(x) = e^x</m> is that <m>h'(x) = e^x</m>; that is, the function <m>e^x</m> is its own derivative.  Suppose that we didn't yet know the coefficients of the Taylor series expansion for <m>e^x</m>, so we just said
              <men xml:id="ez-8a-5-2-exp">
                e^x = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots + a_n x^n + \cdots
              </men>.
              Let <m>x = 0</m> in <xref ref="ez-8a-5-2-exp">Equation</xref>; what does this tell us about the value of <m>a_0</m>?

            <p>    
              Take the derivative of both sides of <xref ref="ez-8a-5-2-exp">Equation</xref> and call your resulting equation for <m>e^x</m> <q>Equation 2</q>.  Why do <xref ref="ez-8a-5-2-exp">Equation</xref> and Equation 2 together tell us that <m>a_1 = a_0</m>?  Combine this observation with your conclusion in (b) and note that you now know the numerical value of both <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m>.
