              In the previous question,
              we observed that <m>75</m> degrees F is the critical temperature that changes
              the behavior of <m>T</m>.
              There are several reasons to think that <m>75</m> degrees F is room temperature:
              if the coffee's temperature is above room temperature (<m>75</m>),
              its temperature will decrease to room temperature,
              while if the coffee is below room temperature,
              its temperature will increase to room temperature.
              Moreover, if the coffee's temperature is <m>75</m>
              (which would match the room temperature),
              then its rate of change is <m>0</m> and the coffee's temperature doesn't change.

              Verify that <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}</m> is the solution to the differential equation with initial value <m>T(0) = 105</m>.
              What happens to this solution after a long time?
              Assuming that <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}</m>, we observe that
              <me permid="pja">
                \frac{dT}{dt} = 30e^{-t/15} \left(-\frac{1}{15} \right) = -2e^{-t/15}
              </me>.
              In addition,
              <me permid="Vqj">
                -\frac{1}{15}T + 5 = -\frac{1}{15}(75 + 30e^{-t/15}) + 5 = -5 - 2e^{-t/15} + 5 = -2e^{-t/15}
              </me>.
              The two preceding equations show that
              <me permid="Bxs">
                \frac{dT}{dt}= -\frac1{15}T+5
              </me>
              when we substitute <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}</m> in for <m>T</m>,
              and thus this function is a solution to the differential equation.
              Moreover, <m>T(0) = 75 + 30e^0 = 75 + 30 = 105</m>,
              so the function satisfies the initial condition, too.
              Finally, because <m>e^{-t/15} \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
              it follows that <m>T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15} \to 75</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>,
              which shows that the solution function's value tends to room temperature as time increases without bound,
              as we expect.
