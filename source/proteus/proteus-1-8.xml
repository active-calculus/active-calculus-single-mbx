  <p>
    [The wording of this question currently sucks.]

    In this activity we'll find the equation of the line through the points <m>(2,3)</m> and <m>(-1,4)</m>, and thereby explain to ourselves why point-slope form works.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Use the slope formula <m>\displaystyle m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}</m> to compute the slope <m>m</m> of the line through the points <m>(2,3)</m> and <m>(-1,4)</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A generic point on the line has coordinates <m>(x,y)</m>. Use the slope formula to compute the slope of the line through the point <m>(2,3)</m> and the generic point <m>(x,y)</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        How should your results in part (a) and part (b) be related? (Gasp they're equal bc a straight line has a single constant slope!!!!)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Use the idea of part (c) to solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>. (But what if people simplify so much that it just becomes slope-intercept again?)
      </p>
