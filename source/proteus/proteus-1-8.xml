  <statement>
    <p>
      In what follows, we find the equation of the line through the points <m>(3,2)</m> and <m>(4,-1)</m>, and remind ourselves why point-slope form works.  
    </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Compute the slope <m>m</m> of the line through the points <m>(3,2)</m> and <m>(4,-1)</m> using the slope formula <m>\displaystyle m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A generic point on the same line has coordinates <m>(x,y)</m>. Use the slope formula <m>\displaystyle m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}</m> to compute the slope of the line 
        through the point <m>(3,2)</m> and the generic point <m>(x,y)</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why are the slopes you found in parts (a) and (b) equal to each other?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Use the result of part (c) to solve for <m>y-2</m>; don't simplify further.  What do you notice? 
      </p>
