  <p>
    The time (<m>T</m>, measured in hours) it takes to drive 50 miles along State Highway 46 depends on the constant speed at which you are driving (<m>s</m>, measured in mph). Since 
    <me>
      \text{distance traveled} = \text{speed}\cdot \text{travel time},
    </me> 
    <m>T(s) = 50/s.</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Draw a graph of this function and explain why the shape of this graph makes sense.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the value of <m>T(60)</m>? Give units on your answer. What does this value mean in context?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Find the average rate of change of <m>T</m> on the interval <m>[60, 65]</m>, <m>AV_{[60, 65]}</m>. Give units on your answer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Does the sign of <m>AV_{[60, 65]}</m> agree with the shape of the graph? make sense? Explain your thinking.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write a sentence in everyday language explaining the meaning of the value <m>AV_{[60, 65]}</m>. Include units in your sentence.

<exercise component="proteus" label="proteus-wind-turbine"  xml:id="proteus-wind-turbine" attachment="yes">
  <p>
    Wind turbines are used to generate electricity. The power, <m>P</m>, measured in watts, depends on the windspeed, <m>s</m>, measured in mph. For a particular wind turbine,
    <me>
      P(s) = 2.4 s^3.
    </me>
    Find the average rate of change of <m>P</m> on the interval <m>[20, 22]</m>, <m>AV_{[20, 22]}</m>, and write a sentence in everyday language explaining the meaning of the value <m>AV_{[20, 22]}</m>. Include units in your sentence.
