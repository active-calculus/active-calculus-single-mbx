    A cylindrical water tank on top of a city water tower has a radius of 8 meters and a height of 15 meters.  The amount of water in the tank changes as water is being pumped in or out, depending on the time of day and the local water usage; it is usually completely refilled by about 2am, and then starts to drain around 7am as people wake up and do morning routines (e.g., showering, cooking, etc.).

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the maximum amount of water the tank can hold? Note: the formula for the volume of a cylinder is <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Draw what you imagine the water in the tanks would look like at 2am, at 8am, and at 11am.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Which measurements of the water are different among your different pictures? Which measurements are the same?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Determine a formula for the volume of water in the tank as a function of only one variable.  What is the varying quantity on which your volume formula depends?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Draw a graph relating the volume of water to the water level, and a second graph relating the volume of water to time.
