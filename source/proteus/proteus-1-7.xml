  <statement>
    <p>
      Imagine that you are tracking the length of your hair as it grows. The growth is roughly linear, at a rate of 0.4 mm per day.  If your hair is 267 mm at the start of this tracking experiment, draw a graph of the function <m>L(t)</m> whose output is the length of your hair after <m>t</m> days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, suppose that after 16 weeks (112 days), you decide to get a haircut.  The stylist cuts off 50 mm.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            How long was your hair when you entered the salon?

          <p>
            How long is your hair when you leave the salon?

            Describe what happens to the graph at the moment the haircut happens.
