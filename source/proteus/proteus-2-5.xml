  <statement>
    <p>
      Each of the functions on the left below could be described as having a specific algebraic structure as noted on the right.  Match each function with its corresponding structure. It is possible that not all structures are used; and it is possible that not all functions have a description for its algebraic structure.
    </p>
  </statement>

    <p>
      Did you compute the derivative of each function in the premises (left column)?

<exercise component="proteus" label="proteus-short-answer-hot-air-balloon">
  <statement>
    <p>
      You are riding a hot air balloon that is moving straight upward. You have access to an altimeter that tells you how high (in miles) above the ground the balloon is at a certain number of hours since the ride started [you can call it <m>A(t)</m>]. You also have access to a gauge that gives the air temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) that you feel as a function of altitude [you can call it <m>F(A)</m>]. 
    </p>

    <p>One hour into the ride, you happen to look at the screen and see the following: <m>A'(1)=2</m> and <m>F'(2)=-16</m>. In your own words state:
    <ol>

      <li><p>What does <m>A'(1) = 2</m> tell you about your ride in the hot air balloon? Include units.</p></li>

      <li><p>What does <m>F'(2) = -16</m> tell you about your ride in the hot air balloon? Include units.</p></li>

      <li><p>Explain in your own words, how the air temperature you feel is changing with time, one hour into the ride, and find that rate.</p></li>
    </ol></p>
