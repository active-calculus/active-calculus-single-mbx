      In <xref ref="PA-2-2">Preview Activity</xref>, we reasoned graphically to sketch the derivative of <m>g(x) = 2^x</m>.  The following questions remind us of some key ideas related to sketching the graph of the derivative, given a graph of the original function.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>q(x) = 2 - (x-1)^2</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this quadratic function.  At what value(s) of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x) = 0</m>?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x)</m> positive?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x)</m> negative?  
        </p>
      </li>  
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this trigonometric function.  State 3 values of <m>x</m> for which <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.  What is one interval values of <m>x</m> on which <m>f'(x)</m> positive?  What is one interval of values of <m>x</m> on which <m>f'(x)</m> negative?

What is one interval values of <m>x</m> on which <m>x</m> is <m>g'(x)</m> positive? What is one interval values of <m>x</m> on which <m>g'(x)</m> is negative?
