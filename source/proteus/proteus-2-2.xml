      In <xref ref="PA-2-2">Preview Activity</xref>, we reasoned graphically to sketch the derivative of <m>g(x) = 2^x</m>.  The following questions remind us of some of the key ideas of sketching the graph of the derivative, given a graph of the original function.
    </p>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Let <m>q(x) = 2 - (x-1)^2</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this quadratic function.  At what value(s) of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x) = 0</m>?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x)</m> positive?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>q'(x)</m> negative?  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        *QUESTION*: <em>would it be helpful to provide axes for students to sketch <m>q</m> and <m>q'</m></em>?
      </p>
    </li>    
    <li>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this trigonometric function.  At what value(s) of <m>x</m> is <m>f'(x) = 0</m>?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>f'(x)</m> positive?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>f'(x)</m> negative?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Let <m>g(x) = \cos(x)</m>, and use a graphing utility to plot this trigonometric function.  At what value(s) of <m>x</m> is <m>g'(x) = 0</m>?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>g'(x)</m> positive?  For what values of <m>x</m> is <m>g'(x)</m> negative?
