<title>PROTEUS exercises</title>
    <p>
    As noted in the introduction to <xref ref="sec-1-6-second-d" text="type-global"/>, we are interested in learning more about how the the second derivative of a function and the behavior of the graph of the function are related.
    </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In the <em>Desmos</em> window below, you will find a graph of a function that you can experiment with by clicking on the point <m>P</m> on the graph, and moving it along the graph of <m>f</m>.  You will also see a green point representing the value of the second derivative of graph of <m>f</m> corresponding to the point <m>P</m>.  As you move the point <m>P</m>, note that the tangent line to the graph moves along with the point.  Then, do the following: 
      </p>
      <p>  
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Carefully observe the shape of the graph and where it opens up versus down. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Investigate the relationship of the tangent line to the graph as you move the point.  For example, at what points is the tangent line above or below the graph?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Notice the sign of the second derivative at various points, by observing the green dot corresponding to <m>P</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the <em>Desmos</em> command line, toggle on the graph of the derivative function and repeat the steps above, paying attention to where the derivative is increasing and decreasing.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
       It will be useful to make a list of your observations as you experiment.

      <match>
      <premise order="1"> <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing </premise>

      <premise order="2"> <m>f'(x)</m> switches between increasing and decreasing </premise> 
      <premise> the tangent line lies both above and below the graph near the point P </premise>
      <premise> the graph switches from opening up to opening down </premise>
        <response> <m>f''(x)=0</m> </response>

      <match>
        <premise order="3"> <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing </premise> 
        <premise> the tangent line lies above the graph near the point P </premise>
        <premise> the graph opens down (is shaped like an upside down bowl)</premise>

        Finally, write a summary of your findings that will help you to understand how the sign of the second derivative relates to the shape of the graph.
