<title>PROTEUS exercises</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-2-4">Preview Activity</xref>, we used the quotient rule to find the derivative of <m>tan(x)</m>.  In the following questions, we explore what the quotient rule yields for two other trigonometric functions that we'll explore in this section.  
    </p>

  <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>h(x) = \sec(x)</m> and recall that <m>\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}</m>.  Apply the quotient rule to find a formula for <m>h'(x)</m> in terms of <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m>.  Don't simplify your result.
