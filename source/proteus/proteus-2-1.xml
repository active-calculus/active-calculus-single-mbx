    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-2-1">Preview Activity</xref>, we learned how to use the limit definition of the derivative to find a formula for <m>f'(x)</m> for a collection of power functions.  A different way to think about derivative formulas for certain kinds of functions is to use the perspective that the derivative measures the slope of the tangent line to a given function.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>f(x) = x</m>, and observe that this function is linear.  What is the value of the slope of <m>f(x) = x</m> at any given point on the graph?  What should be the formula for <m>f'(x)</m>?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For the linear function <m>g(x)=2x+1</m>, what is the value of the slope of <m>g</m> at any point on the graph?  What should be the formula for <m>g'(x)</m>?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>h(x)=7-\frac{2}{3}x</m>, what do you expect will be the formula for <m>h'(x)</m>?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>p(x) = 3x - 5</m> and <m>q(x) = 4x + 8</m>.  If <m>r(x) = p(x) + q(x)</m>, what do you think will be the formula for <m>r'(x)</m>?  Why?
      </p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>p(x) = 3x - 5</m>.  If <m>s(x) = -4 \cdot p(x)</m>, what do you think will be the formula for <m>s'(x)</m>?  Why?
