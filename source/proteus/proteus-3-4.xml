    Suppose you are building a fence around a rectangular field, and the field needs to have an area of 9000 square meters. There are many different shapes of rectangles you could consider.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          One option you have considered is to make the field be a square. Draw a picture of what the field would look like in this case.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Another option you have considered is to make the field more like the shape of a piece of notebook paper. Draw a picture of what the field would look like in this case; remember, it still needs to have an area of 9000 square meters.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Draw at least one more picture of a rectangular field that is a different shape than what youâ€™ve drawn before and would still have an area of 9000 square meters.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Which measurements of your three fields are different? Which measurements of your three fields are the same?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Choose letters to represent the key measurements of the field. What are the lowest and highest values of those measurements?
