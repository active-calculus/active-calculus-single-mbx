  <statement>
    <p>
      In the <em>Desmos</em> window below, there is a plot of the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> along with a tangent line to the circle at a moveable point.  You can drag the point around the circle and observe the corresponding slope of the tangent line.
    </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Estimate the coordinates of a point at which the slope of the tangent line is <m>m=0</m>.

        <p>
          Is there any numerical slope that is not achieved at some point on the circle?  If yes, state that slope; if not, explain why not.
