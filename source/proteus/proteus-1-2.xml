<title>PROTEUS exercises</title>

    <p>
    As noted in <xref ref="PA-1-2" text="type-global"/>, we are interested in studying the behavior of the output of a function as the input value gets closer and closer to a specified chosen number.  One way to visualize this process is to think about a tiny ant walking along the graph of a function, as pictured here:

    <statement>
    <p>
      Focusing on the ant, the <m>x</m>-value that the ant is directly above is the input value to the function, and the <m>y</m>-value at the ant's height (directly across from the ant) is the corresponding output value of the function.  In the figure here, the ant's position corresponds approximately to the point <m>(1.6, f(1.6)) = (1.6, 2.6).</m>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the ant is at the point on the graph directly above <m>x=3</m> what is the ant's height?  In other words, what is the corresponding <m>y</m>-value, <m>y = f(3)</m>?
    </p>

  <exercise component="proteus" label="proteus-und-limits-2"  xml:id="proteus-und-limits-2" attachment="yes">
    <statement>
    <p>
      If the ant walks along the curve in such a way that it gets closer and closer to the location where <m> x = 2 </m>, what happens to the <m>y</m>-value that corresponds to the ant's height?  Does it matter if the ant approaches the location where <m> x = 2 </m> from either the left side or the right side of <m> x = 2 </m>?  Discuss what you see on the graph near the point where <m>x = 2</m>.

    <p>
      Finally, what happens if the ant walks in such a way that the corresponding <m>x</m>-value gets closer and closer to <m>x = -1</m>?  What do you notice about the corresponding output values of the function near the point where <m>x = -1</m>?
