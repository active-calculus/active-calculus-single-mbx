  </objectives>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In our work in <xref ref="sec-8a-2-taylor-poly">Section</xref>, we learned how to find a degree <m>n</m> polynomial approximation centered at a value <m>a</m> for a given function <m>f</m> with at least <m>n</m> derivatives.  By working with several different functions and <m>n</m>-values, we've seen that increasing the degree of the polynomial improves the approximation, and also often helps us to see a pattern in the coefficients of the Taylor polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the degree <m>5</m> Taylor approximation of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> at <m>a = 0</m> is
          <me>
            T_5(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{5}x^5,
          </me>
      and we see a pattern in the coefficients that allows us to easily generate <m>T_6(x)</m>, <m>T_{10}(x)</m>, or indeed <m>T_n(x)</m> for any <m>n</m>.  Note that if we want to use <m>T_{10}(x)</m> to estimate <m>\ln(\frac{3}{2}) = \ln(1 + \frac{1}{2})</m>, we need to compute the sum of <m>10</m> terms given by
          <me>
            \ln\left( \frac{3}{2} \right) \approx T_{10}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 - \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4 + \cdots - \frac{1}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{10}.  
          </me>
      This computation suggests at least two questions:  is there an easy way (without a computer) to determine the exact value of the <m>10</m>-term sum 
      <me>
        \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 - \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4 + \cdots - \frac{1}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{10}
      </me>, 
      and is there a way we can make sense of continuing the sum indefinitely, 
      <me>
        \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 - \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4 + \cdots - \frac{1}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{10} + \cdots?
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we investigate a special collection of similar sums that are called <term>geometric</term>.

  </introduction>  

  <subsection>
    <title>Finite Geometric Series</title>
    <p>
      Sums such as 
      <me>
        1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>,
      <me>
        1 + \frac{1}{4} + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>,
      and 
      <me>
        2 - \frac{4}{3} + \frac{8}{9} - \frac{16}{27} + \cdots + 2 \cdot \left( \frac{-2}{3} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>
      all share a similar structure:  the next term in each sum is found by multiplying the last term by the same number.  In the first sum, each subsequent term is found by multiplying by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>; in the second sum, by multiplying by <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>; in the third sum, the multiplier is <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m>.
      These sums each have the form
      <men xml:id="eq-8-3a-finite-geometric-1">
        a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}
      </men>,
      which we call a <term>finite geometric series</term>
<!--          <idx><h>finite geometric series</h></idx> -->
      with ratio <m>r</m>.  It turns out that the value of each sum that has this form can be computed quickly without having to add all of the individual terms.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8a-3-1.xml" />

    <p>
      The ideas in <xref ref="act-8a-3-1">Activity</xref> can be extended to the general case for any value of <m>a</m> and any value of <m>r \ne 1</m>.  In particular, replacing <m>1</m> with <m>a</m> and <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> with <m>r</m>, our work shows that by finding <m>r \cdot S_n</m> and then subtracting that quantity from <m>S_n</m>, we get 
      <me>
        S_n - rS_n = (a + ar + \cdots + ar^{n-1}) - (ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^n)
      </me>,
      so that
      <me>
        S_n(1-r) = a - ar^n
      </me>,
      and therefore
      <me>
        S_n = \frac{a - ar^n}{1-r}
      </me>.
      We summarize this result formally as follows.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>The value of a finite geometric series</title>
      <p>
        A finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> is a sum of the form
        <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-geometric-series-finite">
          S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}
        </men>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers such that <m>r \ne 1</m>.
        The exact value of the finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> can be computed directly as
        <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-part-sum-geometric">
          S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}

  <subsection>
    <title>Infinite Geometric Series</title>

    <p>
      Our initial introduction to sums with many terms came from Taylor polynomial approximations such as 
      <me>
        e^1 \approx T_5(1) = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} + \frac{1}{5!}      
      </me>.
      Because the approximation gets better as we add more terms, it's natural to think about the possibility of the sum extending forever.  We begin by asking this question for a finite geometric series such as 
      <me>
        S_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1}
      </me>:
      what happens if we let the sum continue indefinitely?
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-8a-3-inf-geom-1">
      <title>An infinite geometric series</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can we find the value of 
        <me>
          1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots
        </me>, 
        where the sum never terminates?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="PA-8a-3">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw that for the finite geometric series
          <me>
            S_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1}
          </me>,
          <m>S_1 = 1</m>, <m>S_2 = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5</m>, <m>S_3 = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75</m>, <m>S_4 = \frac{15}{8} = 1.875</m>, <m>S_5 = \frac{31}{16} = 1.9375</m>, and indeed
          <me>
            S_n = \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} 
          </me>
          so if we multiply both the numerator and denominator by <m>2^n</m>, we find that
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half-closed">
            S_n = \frac{2^n - 1}{2^{n-1}}
          </men>.
          We can view <m>S_n</m> as a <q>partial sum</q> of the infinite geometric series
          <me>
          1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots
          </me>
          whose value we seek.  Plotting these partial sums on a number line, we see evidence that the value of the <m>n</m>th partial sum is approaching <m>2</m>.
        </p>  

    <figure xml:id="F-8a-3-geom-half">
      <caption>A plot of <m>S_1</m>, <m>S_2</m>, <m>S_3</m>, <m>S_4</m>, <m>S_5</m>, and the number <m>2</m> on the interval <m>[1,2]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="images/8a_3_geom_half" />
    </figure>

        <p>
          Indeed, we observe that each partial sum lies halfway between the preceding partial sum and the number <m>2</m>:  <m>S_2 = 1.5</m> is halfway between <m>S_1 = 1</m> and <m>2</m>; <m>S_3 = 1.75</m> is halfway between <m>S_2 = 1.5</m> and <m>2</m>; and so on. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We can see this more formally in <xref ref="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half-closed">Equation</xref> if we divide the two terms in the numerator of <m>S_n</m> by the denominator.  Doing so, an equivalent formula for <m>S_n</m> is 
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half">
            S_n = 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}
          </men>.
          In <xref ref="eq-8a-3-Sn-one-half">Equation</xref>, if we let <m>n \to \infty</m>, we have 
          <me>
            \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \right) = 2
          </me>,
          since <m>\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \to 0</m> as <m>n</m> increases without bound.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, it makes sense to say that the sum of the infinite geometric series 
          <me>
            S = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots
          </me>
          is finite and that <m>S = 2</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      <xref ref="Ex-8a-3-inf-geom-1">Example</xref> demonstrates the general principle that we use to determine if any infinite series has a finite value:  we consider the <term>partial sum</term>, <m>S_n</m>, which is the finite sum of the first <m>n</m> terms, and then investigate if the partial sums converge to a single value as <m>n</m> increases without bound.  For geometric series, determining whether the partial sums converge or not is straightforward.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>The value of an infinite geometric series</title>
      <p>
        An infinite geometric series <m>S</m> is a sum of the form
        <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-geometric-series-infinite">
          S = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} + \cdots
        </men>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers.
        If <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, then the infinite geometric series converges to the finite value
        <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-infinite-geometric-sum">
          S = \frac{a}{1-r}
        </men>.
        If <m>|r| \ge 1</m>, then the infinite geometric series does not converge to a finite value.
      </p>
    </assemblage>   

    <p>
      <xref ref="eq-8a-3-infinite-geometric-sum">Equation</xref> holds because when <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, it follows that <m>r^n \to 0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.  Indeed, when <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, we see by taking the limit as <m>n \to \infty</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-3-geometric-series-finite">Equation</xref>, that
      <me>
        \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r}
      </me>.
      In <xref ref="ez-8a-3-1">Exercise</xref>, we will explore why the infinite geometric series does not converge when <m>|r| = 1</m> and when <m>|r| \gt 1</m>.
    </p> 

    <p>
      As in our work in <xref ref="C-4">Chapter</xref> with Riemann sums, we can use sigma notation (see <xref ref="sigma-notation">Subsection</xref>) to express a sum in convenient shorthand.  For instance, it's equivalent to write
      <me>
        S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, we can use sigma notation for a more concise way to express an infinite geometric series.  For example, it is equivalent to write 
      <me>
        1 + \frac{1}{2} + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \cdots = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^k
      </me>.

    <title>How geometric series naturally connect to Taylor polynomials</title>

    <p>
      If we take <m>a = 1</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-3-infinite-geometric-sum">Equation</xref>, we see that
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-geom-r">
        1 + r + r^2 + \cdots + r^n + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-r}
      </men>,
      provided that <m>|r| \lt 1</m>.  To study this equation further, we are going to let <m>r</m> vary and thus we introduce the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> and replace <m>r</m> by <m>x</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-3-geom-r">Equation</xref> to have
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-3-geom-taylor">
        f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
      </men>,
      which is valid for <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.  One reason this equation is interesting is that we have a function <m>f(x)</m> that can be represented in two different ways:  as the rational function <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>, and as the infinite polynomial function <m>1 + x + x^2 + \cdots</m>.

      For <m>x</m> such that <m>|x| \lt 1</m>, we know that the infinite geometric series <m>1 + x+ x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots</m> converges.  Thus, from <xref ref="eq-8a-3-geom-taylor">Equation</xref>, it follows 
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} \approx 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n
      </me>
      for <m>x</m> near <m>a = 0</m>.
      Moreover, because the infinite series converges, the larger the value of <m>n</m>, the better the approximation will be.  If we plot the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> along with several of the polynomials that arise for different choices of <m>n</m>, say <m>P_1(x) = 1 + x</m>, <m>P_4(x) = 1 + x + \cdots + x^4</m>, and <m>P_7(x) = 1 + x + \cdots + x^7</m>, we can see the impact of increasing the degree <m>n</m> in <xref ref="F-8a-3-geom-x">Figure</xref>.

      In particular, we observe that as the degree of the polynomial approximation increases, the polynomial not only appears closer to <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>, but does so on a wider interval of <m>x</m>-values.  Since the infinite series only converges when <m>|x| \lt 1</m> and the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> is undefined when <m>x = 1</m>, we also expect the approximations to only be accurate on an interval that lies within <m>-1 \lt x \lt 1</m>.  This reminds of our earlier work with Taylor polynomials where in images such as <xref ref="F-8a-2-log-example">Figure</xref>, increasing the degree of the Taylor polynomial similarly improves the approximation.

      In our preceding work in this subsection, we arrived at the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> by starting with the infinite geometric series
      <me>
        1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
      </me>
      and exploring its partial sums.  Next, we change perspective and start with function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> and determine the Taylor polynomial approximations to <m>f</m> that are centered at <m>a = 0</m> in order to see an interesting connection.

          A finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> is a sum of the form
        <me>
          S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}
        </me>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers such that <m>r \ne 1</m>.
        The value of the finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> can be computed directly as
        <me>
          S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}
        </me>.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          An infinite geometric series <m>S</m> is a sum of the form
        <me>
          S = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} + \cdots
        </me>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers.
        If <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, then the infinite geometric series converges to the finite value
        <me>
          S = \frac{a}{1-r}
        </me>.
        If <m>|r| \ge 1</m>, then the infinite geometric series does not converge to a finite sum.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If we consider the infinite geometric series with <m>a = 1</m> and <m>|r| \lt 1</m> and replace <m>r</m> with <m>x</m>, we can say that
          <me>
            \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
          </me>.
          As we found in <xref ref="act-8a-3-3">Activity</xref>, the Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> is precisely the infinite geometric series
          <me>
            T(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots + x^n + \cdots
          </me>
          and we know this series is equal to <m>f(x)</m> for <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.
