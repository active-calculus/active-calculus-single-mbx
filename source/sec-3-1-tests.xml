      In many different settings,
      we are interested in knowing where a function achieves its least and greatest values.
      These can be important in applications <mdash /> say to identify a point at which maximum profit or minimum cost occurs <mdash /> or in theory to characterize the behavior of a function or a family of related functions.

      Consider the simple and familiar example of a parabolic function such as <m>s(t) = -16t^2 + 24t + 32</m>
      (shown at left in <xref ref="F-3-1-Intro">Figure</xref>)
      that represents the height of an object tossed vertically:
      its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola and represents the greatest height the object reaches.
      This maximum value is an especially important point on the graph,
      the point at which the curve changes from increasing to decreasing.

      As seen in <xref ref="F-3-1-extremes">Figure</xref>, when a continuous function defined on <m>(a,b)</m> changes from being always increasing on interval <m>(a,c)</m> to being always decreasing on  interval <m>(c, b)</m> (where <m>a \lt c \lt b</m>), the function has a relative maximum at <m>c</m>.   Similarly, when a continuous function defined on <m>(a,b)</m> changes from being always decreasing on interval <m>(a,c)</m> to being always increasing on  interval <m>(c, b)</m>, the function has a relative minimum at <m>c</m>.
<!--      If a continuous function has a relative maximum at <m>c</m>,
      then it is both necessary and sufficient that the function change from being increasing just before <m>c</m> to decreasing just after <m>c</m>.
      A continuous function has a relative minimum at <m>c</m> if and only if the function changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>c</m>.
      (See <xref ref="F-3-1-extremes">Figure</xref>.) -->
      Because the sign of the derivative changes at such locations, there are only two possible ways for these changes in behavior to occur:
      either <m>f'(c) = 0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined.
      Because these values of <m>c</m> are so important,

        <p permid="WiL">
          Since we already have <m>f'(x)</m> written in factored form,
          it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
          Because <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>,
          we need only determine where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
          From the equation
          <me permid="Afi">
            e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
          </me>
          and the zero product property,
          it follows that <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -1</m> are critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
          (There is no value of <m>x</m> that makes <m>e^{-2x} = 0</m>.)

        <p permid="CpU">
          Next, to apply the first derivative test,
          we'd like to know the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> at inputs near the critical numbers.
          Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <m>f'</m> can change sign,
          it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers:
          for instance,
          the sign of <m>f'</m> must be the same for every <m>x \lt -1</m>.
          We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of <m>f'</m> on the relevant intervals,
          along with the corresponding behavior of <m>f</m>.

        <p permid="ixd">
          To produce the first derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart">Figure</xref>
          we identify the sign of each factor of <m>f'(x)</m> at one selected point in each interval.
          For instance, for <m>x \lt -1</m>,
          we could determine the sign of <m>e^{-2x}</m>,
          <m>(3-x)</m>, and <m>(x+1)^2</m> at the value <m>x = -2</m>.
          We note that both <m>e^{-2x}</m> and <m>(x+1)^2</m> are positive regardless of the value of <m>x</m>,
          while <m>(3-x)</m> is also positive at <m>x = -2</m>.
          Hence, each of the three terms in <m>f'</m> is positive,
          which we indicate by writing <q><m>+++</m>.</q>
          Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <m>f'</m>,
          which we denote by the <q><m>+</m></q>
          in the interval to the left of <m>x = -1</m>.
          And, since <m>f'</m> is positive on that interval,
          we know that <m>f</m> is increasing,
          so we write <q>INC</q>
          to represent the behavior of <m>f</m>.
          In a similar way,
          we find that <m>f'</m> is positive and <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>-1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
          and <m>f'</m> is negative and <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \gt 3</m>.

        <p permid="OEm">
          Now we look for critical numbers at which <m>f'</m> changes sign.
          In this example, <m>f'</m> changes sign only at <m>x = 3</m>,
          from positive to negative,
          so <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = 3</m>.
          Although <m>f</m> has a critical number at <m>x = -1</m>,
          since <m>f</m> is increasing both before and after <m>x = -1</m>,
          <m>f</m> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <m>x = -1</m>.

    <title>The second derivative test</title>
    <p permid="KEn">
      Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself.
      For instance, if <m>f''</m> is positive on an interval,
      then we know that <m>f'</m> is increasing on that interval and,
      consequently, that <m>f</m> is concave up,
      so throughout that interval the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> lies below the curve at every point.
      At a point where <m>f'(p) = 0</m>, 
      the sign of the second derivative determines whether <m>f</m> has a local minimum or local maximum at the critical number <m>p</m>.

      provided <m>f''(p)</m> is not zero on an interval including <m>p</m>
      (except possibly at <m>p</m>).
      On either side of the critical number,
      <m>f''</m> can be either positive or negative,
      and hence <m>f</m> can be either concave up or concave down.
      In the first two graphs,
      <m>f</m> does not change concavity at <m>p</m>, and in those situations,
      <m>f</m> has either a local minimum or local maximum.
      In particular, if <m>f'(p) = 0</m> and <m>f''(p) \lt 0</m>,
      then <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>p</m> with a horizontal tangent line,
      so <m>f</m> has a local maximum there.

          The first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m> is given in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart2">Figure</xref>.

          We see that <m>f</m> is increasing on the intervals
          <m>(-\infty, -\sqrt{3})</m> and <m>(\sqrt{3}, \infty)</m>,
          and <m>f</m> is decreasing on
          <m>(-\sqrt{3},0)</m> and <m>(0, \sqrt{3})</m>.
          By the first derivative test,
          this information tells us that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at
          <m>x = -\sqrt{3}</m> and a local minimum at <m>x = \sqrt{3}</m>.
          Although <m>f</m> also has a critical number at <m>x = 0</m>,
          neither a maximum nor minimum occurs there since <m>f'</m> does not change sign at <m>x = 0</m>.

        <p permid="ngW">
          Next, we move on to investigate concavity.
          Differentiating <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>,
          we see that <m>f''(x) = 12x^3 - 18x</m>.
          Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which <m>f''</m> is positive and negative,
          we first find where <m>f''(x) = 0</m>.
          Observe that
          <me permid="MtA">
            0 = 12x^3 - 18x = 12x\left(x^2 - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 12x\left(x+\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\left(x-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)
          </me>.
          This equation has solutions <m>x = 0, \pm\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}</m>.
          Building a sign chart for <m>f''</m> in the exact same way we do for <m>f'</m>,
          we see the result shown in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart3">Figure</xref>.

          Putting all of this information together,

          The point <m>A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3}))</m> is a local maximum,
          because <m>f</m> is increasing prior to <m>A</m> and decreasing after;
          similarly, the point <m>E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})</m> is a local minimum.
          Note, too, that <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>A</m> and concave up at <m>B</m>,
          which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test.
          At points <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, concavity changes,
          as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart3">Figure</xref>.
          Finally, at point <m>C</m>,
          <m>f</m> has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line,
          but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there,
          since <m>f</m> is decreasing both before and after <m>C</m>.
          It is also the case that concavity changes at <m>C</m>.

        <p permid="LJG">
          While we completely understand where <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing,
          where <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down,
          and where <m>f</m> has relative extremes,
          we do not know any specific information about the <m>y</m>-coordinates of points on the curve.
          For instance,
          while we know that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -\sqrt{3}</m>,
          we don't know the value of that maximum because we do not know <m>f(-\sqrt{3})</m>.
          Any vertical translation of our sketch of <m>f</m> in <xref ref="F-3-1-Ex2">Figure</xref>
          would satisfy the given criteria for <m>f</m>.

      At this point in our study,
      it is important to remind ourselves of the big picture that derivatives help to paint:
      the sign of the first derivative <m>f'</m> tells us <em>whether</em>
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing,
      while the sign of the second derivative <m>f''</m> tells us <em>how</em>
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing.

    <p permid="HJH">
      As we will see in more detail in the following section,
      derivatives also help us to understand families of functions that differ only by changing one or more parameters.
      For instance,
      we might be interested in understanding the behavior of all functions of the form
      <m>f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k</m> where <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>,
      and <m>k</m> are parameters.
      Each parameter has considerable impact on how the graph appears.
