  <introduction>
    <p>
      In our work in <xref ref="C-7">Chapter</xref>, we learned that the natural exponential function, <m>e^x</m>, played a key role in the solution of several important types of differential equations.  In our more recent studies in <xref ref="C-8a">Chapter</xref>, we've learned that <m>e^x</m> can be represented as a Taylor series in the form
      <me>
        e^x = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \cdots + c_n x^n + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k x^k
      </me>.
      Indeed, using the important fact that for <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, we know <m>f^{(k)}(x) = e^x</m> for every natural number <m>k</m>, from which it follows that <m>f^{(k)}(0) = 1</m>, we were able to determine the values of each coefficient <m>c_k</m> for the Taylor series expansion of <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8a-6">Preview Activity</xref>, we explore a different approach to finding the series representation of <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.
