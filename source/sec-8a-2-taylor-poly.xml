  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8a-1-2">Activity</xref>, we investigated a degree <m>3</m> polynomial approximation <m>T_3(x)</m> to <m>f(x) = e^x</m> near <m>a = 0</m>.  To do so, we chose the conditions <m>T_3(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>T_3'(0) = f'(0)</m>, <m>T_3''(0) = f''(0)</m>, and <m>T_3'''(0) = f'''(0)</m>.  Starting with<fn>We used the notation <m>k_0, \ldots, k_3</m> for the constants in our earlier work; here we will use <m>c_0, \ldots, c_3</m>.</fn> <m>T_3(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3</m> and <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and finding the needed derivatives and evaluating them at <m>a = 0</m> led us to the results in <xref ref="T-8a-2-intro">Table</xref>.

    <p>
      Equating the function and derivative values of <m>f</m> and <m>T</m> at <m>a = 0</m>, we found that
      <me>c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1, 2c_2 = 1, 6c_3 = 1</me>
      and therefore
      <me>c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1, c_2 = \frac{1}{2}, c_3 = \frac{1}{6}</me>
      so that <me>T_3(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3</me>.  Moreover, plotting <m>f</m> and <m>T_3</m> near <m>a = 0</m>, we see in the <xref ref="F-8a-2-intro">Figure</xref> that the interval of accuracy for a tolerance of <m>0.1</m> is about <m>-1.2 \le x \le 1.2</m>.

      More precisely, we might compute that <m>|f(-1.16) - T_3(-1.16)| \approx 0.0608</m> and <m>|f(1.16) - T_3(1.16)| \approx 0.0970</m>, which helps us see the degree <m>3</m> approximation is quite accurate on an interval wider than <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.

    <p>
      In this section, we will learn how we can more systematically find degree <m>n</m> approximations for functions such as <m>f(x) = e^x</m> that have at least <m>n</m> derivatives, as well as how to center the approximation at a value other than <m>a = 0</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Taylor polynomials</title>
    <p>
      In our work so far in <xref ref="C-8a">Chapter</xref>, we have found several different approximations of two important functions: <m>e^x</m> and <m>\sin(x)</m>.  In <xref ref="sec-8a-1-linear-poly">Section</xref>, we saw that near <m>a = 0</m>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x</m> (the degree <m>1</m> approximation);
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2</m> (the degree <m>2</m> approximation);  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3</m> (the degree <m>3</m> approximation); and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3 + \frac{1}{24}x^4</m> (the degree <m>4</m> approximation).
          </p>
        </li>        
      </ul>
      Moreover, we found that as the degree of the approximation increased, the polynomial approximation got more accurate by being closer to <m>e^x</m> at each fixed value of <m>x</m> as well as on a wider interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8a-2">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw further that 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sin(x) \approx x</m> (the degree <m>1</m> approximation); and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{1}{6}x^3</m> (the degree <m>3</m> approximation).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can also notice that the linear approximation is embedded within the quadratic approximation, and the quadratic approximation within the cubic one, and so on.  These observations naturally lead us to consider approximations of arbitrary degree <m>n</m> in order to generate more accurate approximations for any function with a sufficient number of derivatives.  We thus define the <term>Taylor polynomial of degree <m>n</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m></term>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-Taylor-poly-0">
      <statement>
         Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>f</m> be a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a = 0</m>.  The <term>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a = 0</m></term> is the function
         <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + \cdots + c_nx^n</me>
         that satisfies
         <m>T_n(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>T_n'(0) = f'(0)</m>, <m>T_n''(0) = f''(0)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(0)</m>.
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      By definition, <m>T_n</m> is the polynomial whose function and first <m>n</m> derivative values at <m>a = 0</m> match the function value and all <m>n</m> derivative values of <m>f</m> at <m>a = 0</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The <m>n+1</m> equations 
      <me>
        T_n(0) = f(0), T_n'(0) = f'(0), T_n''(0) = f''(0), \ldots, T_n^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(0)
      </me> 
      enable us to determine the coefficients <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m> in terms of the values of the various derivatives of <m>f</m>.  First, we take <m>n</m> derivatives of <m>T_n(x)</m>, and assemble those in <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-derivatives">Table</xref>.  As we do so, we choose not to combine products of numbers that arise in order to see certain patterns in the coefficients.

    <p>
      Next, we (1) evaluate each of the derivatives at <m>a = 0</m>, and then (2) set the result equal to the corresponding derivative value of <m>f</m> evaluated at <m>a = 0</m>, which ultimately enables us to determine the coefficients <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m>.

      We see a natural pattern that results from taking the <m>k</m>th derivative of a degree <m>k</m> term.  For example, the repeated derivatives of <m>x^4</m> are <m>4x^3</m>, <m>4 \cdot 3 x^2</m>, <m>4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 x</m>, and finally <m>4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.  By the time we get to the fourth derivative of <m>x^4</m>, only a constant remains, and that constant is the factorial<fn>For any positive whole number <m>n</m>, its factorial, <m>n!</m> is the product of all of the positive whole numbers less than or equal to <m>n</m>: <m>n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.</fn>

      From the rightmost column of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-0">Table</xref>, we now see how the values of <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m> are determined by the values of the various derivatives evaluated at <m>a = 0</m>, each scaled by a corresponding factorial.  In particular, solving each equation in the rightmost column of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-0">Table</xref> for <m>c_k</m>, we see that
      <me>
        c_0 = f(0), c_1 = f'(0), c_2 = \frac{f''(0)}{2!}, c_3 = \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}, c_4 = \frac{f^{(4)}(0)}{4!}, \ldots, c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}
      </me>
      This enables us to find the Taylor polynomial of degree <m>n</m> for any function <m>f</m> by finding the values of <m>f(0), f'(0), \ldots, f^{(n)}(0)</m> and using these numbers to determine <m>c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n</m>.  We summarize our recent work as follows.

        <p>
          When finding the coefficients of a Taylor polynomial, it is often helpful to <em>not</em> combine products such as <m>(-3)(-2)(-1)</m> and <m>(-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)</m> into a single number, in order to better observe patterns; indeed, by not combining the constants that arise in higher derivatives of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>, we see patterns of alternating signs and factorials that arise.  From the right column of <xref ref="T-8a-2-Taylor-example">Table</xref> and the fact that <m>c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}</m>, we see that
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>c_0 = f(0) = 0</m>

              <p>
                <m>c_5 = \frac{1}{5!}f^{(5)}(0) = \frac{(-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)}{5!} = \frac{1}{5}</m>
              </p>
            </li> 
          </ul>
          so that the degree <m>5</m> Taylor approximation of <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> at <m>a = 0</m> is
          <me>
            T_5(x) = 1x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{5}x^5
          </me>.
          Thus, we have found the approximation 
          <me>
            \ln(1+x) \approx 1x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{5}x^5
          </me>,
          and plotting <m>T_5(x)</m> along with <m>f(x)</m> and <m>T_1(x)</m> in <xref ref="F-8a-2-log-example">Figure</xref>, we see how much better the degree <m>5</m> approximation is than the tangent line approximation.

    <p>
      From our work in <xref ref="Ex-8a-2-Taylor-example">Example</xref>, we can also see a pattern that arises and thus we expect the general degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial centered at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m> to be
      <me>
        T_n(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \cdots + (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}x^n.
      </me>
      For many familiar functions, a pattern emerges in their derivatives that enables us to find the general form of the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial.

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8a-2-1.xml" />

    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8a-2-1">Activity</xref>, we found that the degree <m>6</m> Taylor approximation of the cosine function at <m>a = 0</m> is
      <me>
        T_6(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 - \frac{1}{6!}x^6 
      </me>,
      so 
      <me>
        \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 - \frac{1}{6!}x^6 
      </me>.
      We can do similar work to extend what we found in <xref ref="PA-8a-2">Preview Activity</xref> and observe that
      <me>
        \sin(x) \approx T_7(x) = x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7
      </me>,
      using the degree <m>7</m> Taylor approximation of the sine function at <m>a = 0</m>.  Furthermore, as we saw in <xref ref="sec-8a-1-linear-poly">Section</xref>, the degree <m>4</m> Taylor approximation of <m>e^x</m> provides us with the estimate
      <me>
        e^x \approx T_4(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4
      </me>.
      Thus, we now have higher degree Taylor approximations for <m>e^x</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, and <m>\cos(x)</m> that exhibit interesting patterns in their coefficients that we can use to easily find higher degree approximations that are even more accurate.  Indeed, these approximations are what computational devices use to find numerical estimates for quantities such as <m>e^2</m>, <m>\sin(1)</m>, and <m>\cos(1.2)</m>.  For example, 
      <me>
        \sin(1) \approx T_7(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3!}1^3 + \frac{1}{5!}1^5 - \frac{1}{7!}1^7 = \frac{4241}{5040} \approx 0.84146825
      </me>
      which is a remarkably accurate estimate of <m>\sin(1) = 0.84147098 \ldots</m> given that the estimate only involves the sum of four rational numbers.

    <title>
      Taylor polynomial approximations centered at an arbitrary value <m>a</m>
    </title>

    <p>
      In all of our work so far in <xref ref="C-8a">Chapter</xref>, we have focused on approximating functions such as <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x)</m>, and <m>f(x) = \cos(x)</m> near <m>a = 0</m>.  But we could instead be interested in the behavior of some function <m>f</m> near <m>a = 5</m>, or be interested in a function <m>f</m> that wasn't even defined at <m>a = 0</m>.  Thus, we next consider how we can generalize our earlier work to Taylor polynomial approximations centered at any value <m>a</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From our early studies in <xref ref="sec-1-8-tan-line-approx">Section</xref>, we know that at any input value <m>x = a</m> where a function <m>f</m> has a first derivative, <m>f</m> has a tangent line approximation 
      <me>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</me>
      that satisfies <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> for <m>x</m> values near <m>a</m>.  Provided that <m>f</m> has a second derivative at <m>x=a</m>, we can build a quadratic approximation near <m>a</m> for <m>f</m>, similar to the one we found at <m>a = 0</m> for <m>f(x)=e^x</m> in <xref ref="act-8a-1-2">Activity</xref>.  In addition, as long as <m>f</m> has a third derivative at <m>x=a</m>, we can even find a cubic approximation (just as we did at <m>a = 0</m> in <xref ref="act-8a-1-3">Activity</xref>), and so on.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In developing such approximations centered at any value <m>x = a</m>, our guiding principle is the same as with our work at <m>a = 0</m>: we'll require that at the input value <m>a</m>, the original function's output and its derivatives' outputs match the corresponding approximation's output and derivatives' output.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building on the form of the tangent line approximation, which we now denote <m>T_1(x)</m>,
      <me>
        T_1(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
      </me>, 
      it is natural for us to consider a quadratic approximation of form 
      <me>
        T_2(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2
      </me>, 
      a cubic approximation of form 
      <me>
        T_3(x) = c_0 + c_1 (x-a) + c_2 (x-a)^2 + c_3(x-a)^3
      </me>, 
      and so on.  Indeed, we define the degree <m>n</m> Taylor Polynomial centered at <m>a</m> more generally as follows.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-Taylor-poly-a">
      <statement>
         Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>f</m> be a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a</m>.  The <term>degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m></term> is the function
         <me>T_n(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + \cdots + c_n(x-a)^n</me>
         that satisfies
         <m>T_n(a) = f(a)</m>, <m>T_n'(a) = f'(a)</m>, <m>T_n''(a) = f''(a)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)</m>.
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Similar to the situation when <m>a = 0</m>, it follows that we can find the coefficients <m>c_k</m> of the Taylor polynomial in terms of the various derivatives of <m>f</m> evaluated at <m>a</m>.  
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="find-Taylor-poly-a">
      <title>Finding the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m></title>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is a function with at least <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a</m>,
        then the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m>, <m>T_n(x)</m>, is

        <me>c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}</me>.
      </p>

    <p>
      As with approximations centered at <m>a = 0</m>, the Taylor polynomial now provides us with an approximation of <m>f</m> near <m>a</m>.  In particular,

          Just as we can consider any function <m>f</m> that has <m>n</m> derivatives at <m>a = 0</m> and find approximations centered there, we can also consider any input value <m>a</m> at which those <m>n</m> derivatives exist, and find a polynomial approximation that satisfies <m>T_n(a) = f(a)</m>, <m>T_n'(a) = f'(a)</m>, <m>T_n''(a) = f''(a)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>T_n^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)</m>.

        <p>
          At such a value <m>a</m>, the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m> has form
