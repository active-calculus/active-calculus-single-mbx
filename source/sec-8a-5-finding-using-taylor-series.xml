  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, we have focused our attention on a collection of five basic functions functions <mdash/> <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>, <m>\ln(1+x)</m>, <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\cos(x)</m>, and <m>e^x</m> <mdash/> and their Taylor series centered at <m>a = 0</m>.  One of the reasons we were able to find these Taylor series is the patterns that arise in the derivatives of each of these functions.  While we can always use <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref> to find the first few terms of the Taylor series, for most functions it is challenging to find a pattern among the various derivatives that allows us to state the general <m>n</m>th term of the series.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref>, we explore this issue and investigate a different approach to finding the Taylor series of a given function. 
    </p>

  <xi:include href="./previews/PA-8a-5.xml" /> 

  </introduction>  

  <subsection>
    <title>Using substitution and algebra to find new Taylor series expressions</title>
    <p>
      The substitution technique we used in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref> can be used to find the Taylor series for any function whose structure is similar to that of a Taylor series we already know.  
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-8a-5-cosx3">
      <statement>
        Find the Taylor series expansion for <m>g(x) = x^4 \cos(x^3)</m> and determine the <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges.
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because <m>\cos(x^3)</m> is part of the function whose Taylor series we seek, we start with the familiar series for <m>\cos(x)</m>.  We know that 
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosu">
            f(u) = \cos(u) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}u^2 + \frac{1}{4!}u^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} u^{2n} + \cdots
          </men>
          for all real numbers <m>u</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          By letting <m>u = x^3</m> in <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref>, it follows that
          <me>
            \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}(x^3)^2 + \frac{1}{4!}(x^3)^4 - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} (x^3)^{2n} + \cdots
          </me>, 
          so
          <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-cosx3">
            \cos(x^3) = 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^6 + \frac{1}{4!}x^{12} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n} + \cdots
          </men>.      
          Then, multiplying both sides of <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> by <m>x^4</m>, we find that 
          <me>
            g(x) = x^4 \cos(x^3) = x^4 - \frac{1}{2!}x^{10} + \frac{1}{4!}x^{16} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{1}{(2n)!} x^{6n+4} + \cdots
          </me>.
          Since <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosu">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>u</m>, letting <m>u = x^3</m> tells us that <xref ref="eq-8a-5-cosx3">Equation</xref> is valid for every real number <m>x</m>.  The Ratio Test can be used to show that multiplying every term of a Taylor series by the same power of <m>x</m> does not change the set of <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges, so the Taylor series for <m>g(x)</m> also converges for every value of <m>x</m>.
        </p>          
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Because the approaches in <xref ref="PA-8a-5">Preview Activity</xref> and <xref ref="ex-8a-5-cosx3">Example</xref> each require us to use a known Taylor series, we restate the Taylor series we've established so far for <m>5</m> important functions in <xref ref="T-8a-5-big-5-redux">Table</xref>.

    <title>
      Differentiating and integrating Taylor series
    </title>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="C-5">Chapter</xref>, we discussed the challenge posed by definite integrals such as
      <me>
        \int_0^1 \sin(x^2) \, dx
      </me>.
      Because we are unable to find a simple algebraic antiderivative for the function <m>\sin(x^2)</m>, we cannot use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral exactly.  We learned in <xref ref="sec-5-2-FTC2">Section</xref> that the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides us with an antiderivative of a given function by using an integral function: one antiderivative of <m>f(x) = \sin(x^2)</m> is 
      <me>
        F(x) = \int_0^x \sin(u^2) \, du
      </me>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Our recent work with Taylor series now suggests another way to find an antiderivative <m>F(x)</m> for <m>f(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>, and this approach also provides new options for finding additional Taylor series.  In <xref ref="act-8a-5-1">Activity</xref>, as part of our work in finding a Taylor series for <m>x^3 \sin(x^2)</m> we found that
      <men xml:id="eq-8a-5-ex2">
        \sin(x^2) = x^2 - \frac{1}{3!}x^6 + \frac{1}{5!}x^{10} - \frac{1}{7!}x^{14} + \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \frac{1}{(2n-1)!} x^{4n-2} + \cdots
      </men>
      and that this representation of <m>\sin(x^2)</m> is valid for every value of <m>x</m>.  This infinite series representation suggests that we could find an antiderivative <m>F(x)</m> of <m>\sin(x^2)</m> by using <xref ref="eq-8a-5-ex2">Equation</xref> to actually evaluate the integral <m> \int_0^x \sin(u^2) \, du</m>.  Doing so, we see
      <md>
        <mrow>F(x) =\mathstrut \amp \int_0^x \sin(u^2) \, du</mrow>
        <mrow> =\mathstrut \amp \int_0^x \left( u^2 - \frac{1}{3!}u^6 + \frac{1}{5!}u^{10} + \cdots + (-1)^{n+1} \frac{1}{(2n-1)!} u^{4n-2} + \cdots \right) \, du</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \left. \frac{1}{3}u^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} u^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}u^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} u^{4n-1} + \cdots \right|_0^x</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \left( \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} x^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}x^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} x^{4n-1} + \cdots \right) - 0</mrow>    
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} x^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}x^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} x^{4n-1} + \cdots </mrow>                    
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence we have found that 
      <me>
        F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{7 \cdot 3!} x^7 + \frac{1}{11 \cdot 5!}x^{11} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(4n-1)(2n-1)!} x^{4n-1} + \cdots
      </me>
      is an antiderivative of <m>f(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it is natural to wonder how integrating a Taylor series might change the values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges, it turns out that integrating a Taylor series has almost no effect<fn>It is possible for the convergence status at the endpoints of the interval to change, but we are normally not concerned with those specific <m>x</m>-values.</fn> on where the series converges (nor does differentiating such a series).  This fact is stated formally in a result called The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem.  (A <term>power series</term> is any series of the form <m>f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k</m>; every Taylor series is a power series, and a famous result called Borel's Theorem tells us that every power series is in fact the Taylor series of a related function.)
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="T-PS-diff-int">
      <title>The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem</title>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k</m> converges for <m>|x-a| \lt R</m> for a positive real number <m>R</m>, then
        <me>
          f'(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k \cdot c_k (x-a)^{k-1}
        </me>
        and 
        <me>
          \int f(x) \, dx = C + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_k}{k+1} (x-a)^{k+1}
        </me>
        and both of these series converge if <m>|x-a| \lt R</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Stated more informally, the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem tells us that when it comes to differentiating or integrating a Taylor series, we can do so just as if they were finite polynomials:  we can differentiate or integrate the Taylor series term-wise following the Power Rule for differentiating or integrating <m>x^n</m>.  Moreover, doing so doesn't change the interval on which the Taylor series converges<fn>Differentiating or integrating can change the convergence status at the endpoints of the interval, but we again will not concern ourselves with that issue in this course.</fn>.  Since polynomials are the easiest of all functions to differentiate and integrate, we can now find many more Taylor series of interesting functions.

    <p>
      Near the end of <xref ref="sec-8a-4-taylor-series">Section</xref>, we noted the important big-picture perspective that for familiar basic functions that are infinitely differentiable, such as <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, not only can we find the function's Taylor series and determine the <m>x</m>-values for which the Taylor series converges, but <em>the Taylor series converges to the function itself</em>.  Furthermore, we noted that these representations play a key role in how computers provide decimal approxations to quantities such as <m>\sin(1)</m>, which can be represented as 
      <me>
        \sin(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{5!} - \frac{1}{7!} + \cdots
      </me>.
      Our most recent work with Taylor series shows that the news is better still:  now we can easily represent even more complicated functions with Taylor series, such as <m>f(x) = e^{-x^2}</m> and <m>g(x) = \sin(x^2)</m>, and determine their antiderivatives using their infinite Taylor series and treating that representation just like a polynomial.  In the last portion of this section, we investigate further how certain infinite series of numbers can be easily and accurately approximated using partial sums that result from evaluating Taylor series.

        \int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx

      and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to the series representation of <m>e^{-x^2}</m>, we find that

      The infinite series in <xref ref="eq-8a-5-alt-sum-ex2">Equation</xref> is an example of an <term>alternating series</term> of real numbers.  It turns out to be straightforward to determine whether or not an alternating series converges, and also to estimate the value of a convergent alternating series. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An alternating series is a series of the form
          <me>
            \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k
          </me>,
          where <m>a_k \gt 0</m> for each <m>k</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We will only consider alternating series for which the sequence of positive numbers <m>a_k</m> decreases to <m>0</m>.  The following example illustrates two general results that hold for any alternating series whose terms <m>a_k</m> decrease to <m>0</m>.  We use a geometric series so that we can know its exact sum and compare certain computations to that sum.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-8a-5-alt-geom">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Investigate the partial sums of the alternating geometric series <m>S = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^k</m>.  How do the partial sums compare to the exact sum of the series, and how can partial sums accurately estimate the value of the sum?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, recall that the <m>n</m>th partial sum is the sum of the first <m>n</m> terms, so

            S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^k = 1 - \frac{4}{5} + \frac{16}{25} - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^{n-1}

        <p>
          Because the given series <m>S = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^k</m> is geometric with <m>a = 1</m> and <m>r = -\frac{4}{5}</m>, we know the series converges and its sum is
          <me>
            S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{1}{\frac{9}{5}} = \frac{5}{9} \approx 0.5555
          </me>.
          Knowing this value helps us better understand the behavior of the partial sums.
        </p>

        <p>
          In both the table and the figure, we see how consecutive partial sums move back and forth above and below the exact sum of the infinite series, <m>\frac{5}{9}</m>, and moreover how the amount the next partial sum lies above or below <m>\frac{5}{9}</m> is less than the amount by which the previous partial sum deviated.  For instance, 
          <me>
            |S_5 - \frac{5}{9}| \approx 0.1820,
          </me>
          but 
          <me>
            |S_6 - \frac{5}{9}| \approx 0.1456
          </me>.
          Moreover, since <m>S_6 = S_5 - \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^5</m>, and <m>-\left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^5 = -0.32768</m> is the last and smallest term (in absolute value) in <m>S_6</m>, <m>0.32768</m> is the total vertical distance from the point <m>(5, S_5)</m> to <m>(6, S_6)</m> in <xref ref="F-8a-5-ExGeom">Figure</xref>.  This implies that <m>0.32768</m> is more than the error in comparing <m>S_5</m> and <m>S</m>.  Said differently, we are guaranteed that
          <me>
            |S - S_5| \lt \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^5
          </me>
          so the next term in the sum provides a bound on the error in a given partial sum.  A similar argument can be made for any value of <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>  
      The arguments <xref ref="eq-8a-5-alt-sum-ex2">Example</xref> can be made for any alternating series whose terms go to zero.  This leads us to state two important results.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>The Alternating Series Test</title>
      <p>
        Given an alternating series
        <me>
        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k
        </me>,
        if the positive terms <m>a_k</m> decrease to 0 as <m>k \to \infty</m>,
        then the alternating series converges.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      If we were to compute the partial sums <m>S_n</m> of any alternating series whose terms decrease to zero and plot the points <m>(n,S_n)</m> as we did in <xref ref="F-8a-5-ExGeom">Figure</xref>, we would see a similar picture:  the partial sums alternate above and below the value to which the infinite alternating series converges.  In addition, because the terms go to zero, the amount a given partial sum deviates from the total sum is at most the next term in the series.  This result is formally stated as the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Alternating Series Estimation Theorem</title>
      <p>
        If the alternating series
        <m>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k
        </m>
        has positive terms <m>a_k</m> that decrease to zero as <m>k \to \infty</m>, and
        <m>
        S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1}a_k
        </m>
        is the <m>n</m>th partial sum of the alternating series, then
        <me>
          \left| \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k - S_n \right| \leq a_{n+1}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Again, this result simply says: if we use a partial sum to estimate the exact sum of an alternating series, the absolute error of the approximation is less than the next term in the series.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-8a-5-ASET">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Determine how well the <m>100</m>th partial sum <m>S_{100}</m> of
          <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}
          </me>
          approximates the value of the converging alternating series.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If we let <m>S</m> be the value of the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}</m>,
          then we know that
          <me>
            \left| S_{100} - S \right| \lt  a_{101}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now
          <me>
            a_{101} = \frac{1}{101} \approx 0.0099
          </me>,
          so the 100th partial sum is within 0.0099 of the exact value of the series.  In addition, it turns out that <m>S_{100} \approx 0.688172</m> and <m>S = \ln(2) \approx 0.69314</m>, so we see that the difference between <m>S_{100}</m> and <m>S</m> is indeed less than the error bound of <m>0.0099</m> from the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.

        <p>
          Through substitution, we can use any known Taylor series to find the Taylor series of a related function.  For example, we know that if <m>|u| \lt 1</m>, 
          <me>
            \ln(1+u) = u - \frac{1}{2}u^2 + \frac{1}{3}u^3 - \frac{1}{4}u^4 + \cdots
          </me>
          Letting <m>u = 4x^2</m>, it follows that 
          <me>
            \ln(1+4x^2) = 4x^2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16x^4 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 64x^6  - \frac{1}{4} \cdot 256x^8 + \cdots
          </me>
          and that this representation converges if <m>|4x^2| \lt 1</m>, so for <m>x</m> such that <m>|x| \lt \frac{1}{2}</m>.

          The Power Series Differentation and Integration Theorem tells us that we can differentiate or integrate a Taylor series in the natural way and that doing so has essentially no impact on the set of <m>x</m>-values for which the series converges.  For instance, we might note that if we first found the Taylor series for <m>\sin(x)</m>, which is
          <me>
            \sin(x) = x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7 + \cdots
          </me>
          and converges for every value of <m>x</m>, it follows by differentating that
          <md>
            <mrow>\cos(x) =\mathstrut \amp \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]</mrow>
            <mrow>        =\mathstrut \amp \frac{d}{dx}[x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7 + \cdots]</mrow>
            <mrow>        =\mathstrut \amp 1 - \frac{1}{3!} \cdot 3x^2 + \frac{1}{5!} \cdot 5x^4 - \frac{1}{7!} \cdot 7x^6 + \cdots</mrow>
            <mrow>        =\mathstrut \amp 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!} x^4 - \frac{1}{6!} x^6 + \cdots</mrow>
          </md>
          which is precisely the Taylor series for <m>\cos(x)</m> that we found by taking derivatives and applying <xref ref="D-8a-4-Taylor-series">Definition</xref>.

          An alternating series is one whose terms alternate in sign, usually represented by <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k</m> where <m>a_k \gt 0</m> for all values of <m>k</m>.  Any alternating series whose terms <m>a_k</m> approach zero as <m>k \to \infty</m> is guaranteed to converge.  Moreover, the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem tells us that we can estimate the exact value of a converging alternating series by using a partial sum, and the error of that approximation is at most the next term in the series.  That is,
          <me>
            \left| \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k - \left(a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \cdots + (-1)^{n+1} a_n \right) \right| \lt a_{n+1}
          </me>.
