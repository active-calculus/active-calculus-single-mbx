  <introduction permid="fgl">
    <p permid="pjR">
      In Section 1.1 we used a function, <m>s(t)</m>,
      to model the location of a moving object at a given time.
      Functions can model other interesting phenomena,
      such as the rate at which an automobile consumes gasoline at a given velocity,
      or the reaction of a patient to a given dosage of a drug.
      We can use calculus to study how a function value changes in response to changes in the input variable.
    </p>

    <p permid="Vra">
      Think about the falling ball whose position function is given by <m>s(t) = 64 - 16t^2</m>.
      Its average velocity on the interval <m>[1,x]</m> is given by
      <me permid="Xgn">
        AV_{[1,x]} = \frac{s(x) - s(1)}{x-1} = \frac{(64-16x^2) - (64-16)}{x-1} = \frac{16 - 16x^2}{x-1}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Byj">
      Note that the average velocity is a function of <m>x</m>.
      That is, the function <m>g(x) = \frac{16 - 16x^2}{x-1}</m> tells us the average velocity of the ball on the interval from <m>t = 1</m> to <m>t = x</m>.
      To find the instantaneous velocity of the ball when <m>t = 1</m>,
      we need to know what happens to <m>g(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer to <m>1</m>.
      But also notice that <m>g(1)</m> is not defined,
      because it leads to the quotient <m>0/0</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="hFs">
      This is where the notion of a <em>limit</em> comes in.
      By using a limit,
      we can investigate the behavior of <m>g(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets arbitrarily close,
      but not equal, to <m>1</m>.
      We first use the graph of a function to explore points where interesting behavior occurs.

    <title>The Notion of Limit</title>
    <p permid="NMB">
      Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest.
      We need a precise understanding of what it means to say 
      <q>a function <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.</q> To begin,
      think about a recent example.
    </p>

    <p permid="tTK">
      In <xref ref="PA-1-2">Preview Activity</xref>,
      we saw that 
      as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
      (but not equal)
      to 0, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to the value 4.
      At first, this may feel counterintuitive,
      because the value of <m>g(0)</m> is <m>1</m>, not <m>4</m>.
      But limits describe the behavior of a function
      <em>arbitrarily close to</em> a fixed input,
      and the value of the function <em>at</em>
      the fixed input does not matter.
      More formally,<fn>
      What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit.
      To be completely precise,
      it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say
      <q>as close to <m>L</m> as we like</q>
      and <q>sufficiently close to <m>a</m>.</q>
      That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits.
      The definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.
      </fn> we say the following.
    </p>

    <definition permid="upj">
      <statement>
        <p permid="kzY">
          Given a function <m>f</m>,
          a fixed input <m>x = a</m>, and a real number <m>L</m>,
          we say that <term><m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m></term>,
              <idx><h>limit</h><h>definition</h></idx>
          and write
          <me permid="Dnw">
            \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
          </me>
          provided that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
          (but not equal)
          to <m>a</m>.
          If we cannot make <m>f(x)</m> as close to a single value as we would like as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>,
          then we say that <term><m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.</term>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example permid="aws">
      <statement>
        <p permid="QHh">
          For the function <m>g</m> pictured in <xref ref="F-1-2-PA1">Figure</xref>,
          we make the following observations:
          <me permid="juF">
            \lim_{x \to -1} g(x) = 3, \  \lim_{x \to 0} g(x) = 4, \ \text{and}  \  \lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = 1
          </me>.
          When working from a graph,
          it suffices to ask if the function <em>approaches</em>
          a single value from each side of the fixed input.
          The function value <em>at</em> the fixed input is irrelevant.
          This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.
        </p>

        <p permid="wOq">
          However, <m>g</m> does not have a limit as <m>x \to 1</m>.  
          There is a jump in the graph at <m>x = 1</m>.
          If we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the left,
          the function values tend to get close to 3,
          but if we approach <m>x = 1</m> from the right,
          the function values get close to 2.
          There is no single number that all of these function values approach.
          This is why the limit of <m>g</m> does not exist at <m>x = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p permid="aaT">
      For any function <m>f</m>,
      there are typically three ways to answer the question
      <q>does <m>f</m> have a limit at <m>x = a</m>, and if so,
      what is the limit?</q> The first is to reason graphically as we have just done with the example from <xref ref="PA-1-2">Preview Activity</xref>.
      If we have a formula for <m>f(x)</m>,
      there are two additional possibilities:

      <ol marker="1" permid="DIV">
        <li permid="NcH">
          Evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach <m>a</m> on either side
          (typically using some sort of computing technology),
          and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value.
        </li>

        <li permid="tjQ">
          Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach <m>a</m>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      The first approach produces only an approximation of the value of the limit,
      while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly.
    </p>

      <title>Limits of Two Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p permid="cVz">
          For each of the following functions,
          we'd like to know whether or not the function has a limit at the stated <m>a</m>-values.
          Use both numerical and algebraic approaches to investigate and,
          if possible, estimate or determine the value of the limit.
          Compare the results with a careful graph of the function on an interval containing the points of interest.

        <p permid="ORU">
          From <xref ref="table-1-F-1-2-Ex1f">Table</xref>,
          it appears that we can make <m>f</m> as close as we want to 3 by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>-1</m>,
          which suggests that <m>\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = 3</m>.
          This is also consistent with the graph of <m>f</m>.
          To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view,
          consider the formula for <m>f</m>:
          <m>f(x) = \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}</m>.
          As <m>x \to -1</m>,
          <m>(4-x^2) \to (4 - (-1)^2) = 3</m>,
          and <m>(x+2) \to (-1 + 2) = 1</m>, so as <m>x \to -1</m>,
          the numerator of <m>f</m> tends to 3 and the denominator tends to 1, hence <m>\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = \frac{3}{1} = 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="uZd">
          The situation is more complicated when <m>x \to -2</m>,
          because <m>f(-2)</m> is not defined.
          If we try to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator,
          we observe that as <m>x \to -2</m>,
          <m>(4-x^2) \to (4 - (-2)^2) = 0</m>,
          and <m>(x+2) \to (-2 + 2) = 0</m>, so as <m>x \to -2</m>,
          the numerator and denominator of <m>f</m> both tend to 0.
          We call <m>0/0</m> an <em>indeterminate form</em>.
              <idx><h>indeterminate form</h></idx>
          This tells us that there is somehow more work to do.
          From <xref ref="table-2-F-1-2-Ex1f">Table</xref>
          and <xref ref="plot-F-1-2-Ex1f">Figure</xref>,
          it appears that <m>f</m> should have a limit of <m>4</m> at <m>x = -2</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="bgm">
          To see algebraically why this is the case, observe that
          <md permid="PBO">
            <mrow>\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{(2-x)(2+x)}{x+2}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Hnv">
          It is important to observe that,
          since we are taking the limit as <m>x \to -2</m>,
          we are considering <m>x</m> values that are close,
          but not equal, to <m>-2</m>.
          Because we never actually allow <m>x</m> to equal <m>-2</m>,
          the quotient <m>\frac{2+x}{x+2}</m> has value 1 for every possible value of <m>x</m>.
          Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above,
          and find that
          <me permid="vIX">
            \lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2} 2-x
          </me>.
          This limit is now easy to determine,
          and its value clearly is <m>4</m>.
          Thus, from several points of view we've seen that <m>\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = 4</m>.

          First, as <m>x \to 3</m>, it appears from the table values
          that the function is approaching a number between <m>0.86601</m> and <m>0.86604</m>.
          From the graph it appears that <m>g(x) \to g(3)</m> as <m>x \to 3</m>.
          The exact value of <m>g(3) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{3})</m> is <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>,
          which is approximately 0.8660254038.
          This is convincing evidence that
          <me permid="bQg">
            \lim_{x \to 3} g(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
          </me>.

        <p permid="zIW">
          As <m>x \to 0</m>, we observe that
          <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> does not behave in an elementary way.
          When <m>x</m> is positive and approaching zero,
          we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values,
          and <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> increases without bound.
          When <m>x</m> is negative and approaching zero,
          <m>\frac{\pi}{x}</m> decreases without bound.
          In this sense, as we get close to <m>x = 0</m>,
          the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly,
          and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of <m>g</m> betweem <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>.
          If we plot the function
          <m>g(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)</m> with a graphing utility and then zoom in on <m>x = 0</m>,
          we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin,
          which suggests that <m>g</m> does not have a limit at <m>x = 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="fQf">
          How do we reconcile the graph with the righthand table above,
          which seems to suggest that the limit of <m>g</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> may in fact be <m>0</m>?
          The data misleads us because of the special nature of the sequence of input values <m>\{0.1, 0.01, 0.001, \ldots\}</m>.
          When we evaluate <m>g(10^{-k})</m>,
          we get <m>g(10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{10^{-k}}\right) = \sin(10^k \pi) = 0</m> for each positive integer value of <m>k</m>.
          But if we take a different sequence of values approaching zero,
          say <m>\{0.3, 0.03, 0.003, \ldots\}</m>, then we find that
          <me permid="HXp">
            g(3 \cdot 10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3 \cdot 10^{-k}}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{10^k \pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866025
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="LXo">
          That sequence of function values suggests that the value of the limit is <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>.
          Clearly the function cannot have two different values for the limit,
          so <m>g</m> has no limit as <m>x \to 0</m>.

    <p permid="Gic">
      An important lesson to take from <xref ref="Ex-1-2-Limits">Example</xref>
      is that tables can be misleading when determining the value of a limit.
      While a table of values is useful for investigating the possible value of a limit,
      we should also use other tools to confirm the value.

      Recall that our primary motivation for considering limits of functions comes from our interest in studying the rate of change of a function.
      To that end,
      we close this section by revisiting our previous work with average and instantaneous velocity and highlighting the role that limits play.

    <title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
    <p permid="Swu">
      Suppose that we have a moving object whose position at time <m>t</m> is given by a function <m>s</m>.
      We know that the average velocity of the object on the time interval <m>[a,b]</m> is <m>AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}</m>.
      We define the <em>instantaneous velocity</em>
          <idx><h>instantaneous velocity</h></idx>
      at <m>a</m> to be the limit of average velocity as <m>b</m> approaches <m>a</m>.
      Note particularly that as <m>b \to a</m>,
      the length of the time interval gets shorter and shorter
      (while always including <m>a</m>).
      We will write <m>IV_{t=a}</m> for the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = a</m>, and thus
      <me permid="oey">
        IV_{t=a} = \lim_{b \to a} AV_{[a,b]} = \lim_{b \to a} \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="yDD">
      Equivalently,
      if we think of the changing value <m>b</m> as being of the form <m>b = a + h</m>,
      where <m>h</m> is some small number, then we may instead write
      <me permid="UlH">
        IV_{t=a} = \lim_{h \to 0} AV_{[a,a+h]} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="eKM">
      Again, the most important idea here is that to compute instantaneous velocity,
      we take a limit of average velocities as the time interval shrinks.
