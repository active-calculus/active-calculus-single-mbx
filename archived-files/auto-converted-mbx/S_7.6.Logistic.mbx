    <p>The growth of the earth's population is one of the pressing issues of
      our time. Will the population continue to grow? Or will it perhaps
      level off at some point, and if so, when? In this section, we
      will look at two ways in which we may use differential equations to
      help us address questions such as these.</p>

    <p>Before we begin, let's consider again two important differential
      equations that we have seen in earlier work this chapter.</p>

    <exploration xml:id="PA_7.6">
      <p>Recall that one model for population growth states that a population grows at a rate proportional to its size.

        <li><p>We begin with the differential equation
            <me>
              \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac12 P.

      <p>Our first model will be based on the following assumption:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <em>The rate of change of the population is proportional to the
            population.  
          </em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>On the face of it, this seems pretty reasonable. When there is a
        relatively small number of people, there will be fewer births and
        deaths so the rate of change will be small. When there is a larger
        number of people, there will be more births and deaths so we expect
        a larger rate of change.</p>

      <p>If <m>P(t)</m> is the population <m>t</m> years after the year 2000, we may
      express this assumption as

    <p>Our work in <xref ref="A_7.6.1">Activity</xref> shows that that the exponential model is fairly accurate for years
      relatively close to 2000. However, if we go too far into the
      future, the model predicts increasingly large rates of change, which
      causes the population to grow arbitrarily large. This does not make
      much sense since it is unrealistic to expect that the earth would be able to support
      such a large population.</p>

    <p>The constant <m>k</m> in the differential equation has an important
      interpretation. Let's rewrite the differential equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</m> by solving for <m>k</m>, so that we have
      <me>
        k = \frac{dP/dt}{P}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Viewed in this light, <m>k</m> is the ratio of the rate of change to the
      population; in other words, it is the contribution to the rate of change
      from a single person. We call this the <em>per capita
      growth rate</em><index><main>per capita growth rate</main></index>.</p>

    <p>In the exponential model we introduced in <xref ref="A_7.6.1">Activity</xref>, the per capita growth rate is
      constant. In particular, we are assuming that when the population is
      large, the per capita growth rate is the same as when the population
      is small. It is natural to think that the per capita growth rate should
      decrease when the population becomes large, since there will not be
      enough resources to support so many people. In other words, we expect that a more realistic model would hold if we assume
      that the per capita growth rate depends on the population <m>P</m>.</p>

    <p>In the previous activity, we computed the per capita growth rate in a
      single year by computing <m>k</m>, the quotient of <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> and <m>P</m> (which we did for <m>t = 0</m>). If we return data and compute the per capita
      growth rate over a range of years, we generate the data shown in <xref ref="F_7.6.census">Figure</xref>, which shows how the per capita growth rate is a function of the population, <m>P</m>.</p>

    <figure xml:id="F_7.6.census" >
      <caption>A plot of per capita growth rate vs.<nbsp />population <m>P</m>.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/7_6_census" />
    </figure>

    <p>From the data, we see that the per capita growth rate appears to decrease as
      the population increases. In fact, the points seem to lie very close
      to a line, which is shown at two different scales in <xref ref="F_7.6.census1">Figure</xref>.</p>

    <figure xml:id="F_7.6.census1" >
      <caption>The line that approximates per capita growth as a function of population, <m>P</m>.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/7_6_census_1" />
      <image width="73%" source="images/7_6_census_2" />
    </figure>

    <p>Looking at this line carefully, we can find its equation to be
      <me>
        \frac{dP/dt}{P} = 0.025 - 0.002P.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>If we multiply both sides by <m>P</m>, we arrive at the differential
      equation
      <me>
        \frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Graphing the dependence of <m>dP/dt</m> on the population <m>P</m>, we see that this differential equation demonstrates a quadratic relationship between <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> and <m>P</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F_7.6.logistic">Figure</xref>.</p>

    <figure xml:id="F_7.6.logistic" >
      <caption>A plot of <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> vs.<nbsp /><m>P</m> for the differential equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/7_6_logistic_de" />
    </figure>

    <p>The equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)</m> is an example of the <em>logistic equation</em>,
      and is the second model for population growth that we will consider. We
      have reason to believe that it will be more realistic since the per
      capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the population.</p>

    <p>Indeed, the graph in <xref ref="F_7.6.logistic">Figure</xref> shows that there are two equilibrium
      solutions, <m>P=0</m>, which is unstable, and <m>P=12.5</m>, which is a stable
      equilibrium. The graph shows that any solution with <m>P(0) >0</m> will
      eventually stabilize around 12.5. In other words, our model predicts
      the world's population will eventually stabilize around 12.5
      billion.</p>

    <p>A prediction for the long-term behavior of the population is a
      valuable conclusion to draw from our differential equation. We would,
      however, like to answer some quantitative questions. For instance,
      how long will it take to reach a population of 10 billion? To determine this,
      we need to find an explicit solution of the equation.</p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Solving the logistic differential equation</title>
    <p><index><main>logistic</main></index></p>

    <p>Since we would like to apply the logistic model in more general situations, we state the logistic equation<index><main>logistic equation</main></index> in its more general form,
      <men xml:id="E_7.6.logistic" >
        \frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P).
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>The equilibrium solutions here are when <m>P=0</m> and <m>1-\frac PN = 0</m>,
      which shows that <m>P=N</m>. The equilibrium at <m>P=N</m> is called the <em>carrying capacity</em><index><main>carrying capacity</main></index> of the population for it represents the stable
      population that can be sustained by the environment.</p>

    <p>We now solve the logistic equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E_7.6.logistic" />. The equation is separable, so we separate the variables
      <me>
        \frac{1}{P(N-P)}\frac{dP}{dt} = k,
      </me>
      and integrate to find that
      <me>
        \int \frac{1}{P(N-P)}~dP = \int k~dt.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>To find the antiderivative on the left, we use the partial fraction decomposition
      <me>
        \frac{1}{P(N-P)} = \frac 1N\left[\frac 1P + \frac 1{N-P}\right].
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Now we are ready to integrate, with
      <me>
        \int \frac 1N\left[\frac 1P + \frac 1{N-P}\right] ~dP  =  \int k~dt.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>On the left, observe that <m>N</m> is constant, so we can remove the factor of <m>\frac{1}{N}</m> and antidifferentiate to find that
      <me>
        \frac 1N (\ln|P| - \ln|N-P|)  =  kt + C.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Multiplying both sides of this last equation by <m>N</m> and using an important rule of logarithms, we next find that
      <me>
        \ln\left|\frac{P}{N-P}\right| = kNt + C.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>From the definition of the logarithm, replacing <m>e^C</m> with <m>C</m>, and letting <m>C</m> absorb the absolute value signs, we now know that
      <me>
        \frac{P}{N-P} =  Ce^{kNt}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>At this point, all that remains is to determine <m>C</m> and solve algebraically for <m>P</m>.</p>

    <p>If the initial population is <m>P(0) = P_0</m>, then it follows that <m>C = \frac{P_0}{N-P_0}</m>, so
      <me>
        \frac{P}{N-P} = \frac{P_0}{N-P_0}e^{kNt}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>We will solve this most recent equation for <m>P</m> by multiplying both sides by
      <m>(N-P)(N-P_0)</m> to obtain
      <md>
        <mrow>P(N-P_0) =\mathstrut \amp  P_0(N-P)e^{kNt}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  P_0Ne^{kNt} - P_0Pe^{kNt}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>Swapping the left and right sides, expanding, and factoring, it follows that
      <md>
        <mrow>P_0Ne^{kNt} =\mathstrut \amp  P(N-P_0) + P_0 Pe^{kNt}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  P(N-P_0 + P_0e^{kNt}).</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>Dividing to solve for <m>P</m>, we see that
      <me>
        P = \frac{P_0Ne^{kNt}}{N-P_0 + P_0e^{kNt}}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Finally, we choose to multiply the numerator and denominator by <m>\frac{1}{P_0}e^{-kNt}</m>
      to obtain
      <me>
        P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>While that was a lot of algebra, notice the result: we have
      found an explicit solution to the initial value problem
      <me>
        \frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P), \ P(0) = P_0,
      </me>
      and that solution<index><main>logistic equation</main><sub>solution</sub></index> is
      <men xml:id="E_7.6.logistic_solution" >
        P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}.
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>For the logistic equation describing the earth's population that we worked with earlier in this section, we have
      <me>
        k=0.002,  N= 12.5,  \mbox{and}   P_0 = 6.084.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>This gives the solution
      <me>
        P(t) = \frac{12.5}{1.0546e^{-0.025t} + 1},
      </me>
      whose graph is shown in <xref ref="F_7.6.logistic_sol">Figure</xref></p>

    <figure xml:id="F_7.6.logistic_sol" >
      <caption>The solution to the logistic equation modeling the earth's population.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/7_6_logistic_sol" />
    </figure>

    <p>Notice that the graph shows the population leveling off at 12.5 billion, as
      we expected, and that the population will be around 10 billion in the
      year 2050. These results, which we have found using a relatively simple
      mathematical model, agree fairly well with predictions made using a
      much more sophisticated model developed by the United Nations.</p>

    <p>The logistic equation is useful in other situations, too, as it is good for modeling any situation in which limited growth is possible. For instance, it could model the spread of a flu virus through a population contained on a cruise ship, the rate at which a rumor spreads within a small town, or the behavior of an animal population on an island. Again, it is important to realize that through our work in this section, we have completely solved the logistic equation, regardless of the values of the constants <m>N</m>, <m>k</m>, and <m>P_0</m>. Anytime we encounter a logistic equation, we can apply the formula we found in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E_7.6.logistic_solution" />.</p>

          through a group of people. Suppose that <m>p(t)</m> is the fraction of
          people that have heard the rumor on day <m>t</m>. The equation

            \frac{dp}{dt} = 0.2p(1-p)
          </me>
          describes how <m>p</m> changes. Suppose initially that one-tenth of
          the people have heard the rumor; that is, <m>p(0) = 0.1</m>.

          <p>Suppose that <m>b(t)</m> measures the number of bacteria living in
          a colony in a Petri dish, where <m>b</m> is measured in thousands and
          <m>t</m> is measured in days. One day, you measure that there are
          6,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 3. A few days
          later, you measure that there are 9,000 bacteria and the per
          capita growth rate is 2.

            <li><p>Assume that the per capita growth rate 
                    <m>\frac{db/dt}{b}</m> is a linear function of <m>b</m>.  Use the
