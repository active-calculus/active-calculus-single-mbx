    <p>Throughout <xref ref="C_2">Chapter</xref>, we will be working to develop shortcut derivative rules that will help us to bypass the limit definition of the derivative in order to quickly determine the formula for <m>f'(x)</m> when we are given a formula for <m>f(x)</m>. In <xref ref="S_2.1.ElemRules">Section</xref>, we learned the rule for power functions, that if <m>f(x) = x^n</m>, then <m>f'(x) = nx^{n-1}</m>, and justified this in part due to results from different <m>n</m>-values when applying the limit definition of the derivative. We also stated the rule for exponential functions, that if <m>a</m> is a positive real number and <m>f(x) = a^x</m>, then <m>f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)</m>. Later in this present section, we are going to work to conjecture formulas for the sine and cosine functions, primarily through a graphical argument. To help set the stage for doing so, the following preview activity asks you to think about exponential functions and why it is reasonable to think that the derivative of an exponential function is a constant times the exponential function itself.</p>

    <title>The sine and cosine functions</title>
    <p>The sine and cosine functions are among the most important functions in all of mathematics. Sometimes called the <em>circular</em> functions due to their genesis in the unit circle
      , these periodic functions play a key role in modeling repeating phenomena such as the location of a point on a bicycle tire, the behavior of an oscillating mass attached to a spring, tidal elevations, and more. Like polynomial and exponential functions, the sine and cosine functions are considered basic functions, ones that are often used in the building of more complicated functions. As such, we would like to know formulas for <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)]</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)]</m>, and the next two activities lead us to that end.</p>

    <p>The results of the two preceding activities suggest that the sine and cosine functions not only have the beautiful interrelationships that are learned in a course in trigonometry <mdash /> connections such as the identities <m>\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1</m> and <m>\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(x)</m> <mdash /> but that they are even further linked through calculus, as the derivative of each involves the other. The following rules summarize the results of the activities<fn>These two rules may be formally proved using the limit definition of the derivative and the expansion identities for <m>\sin(x+h)</m> and <m>\cos(x+h)</m>.</fn>.</p>

    <p>We have now added two additional functions to our library of basic functions whose derivatives we know: power functions, exponential functions, and the sine and cosine functions. The constant multiple and sum rules still hold, of course, and all of the inherent meaning of the derivative persists, regardless of the functions that are used to constitute a given choice of <m>f(x)</m>. The following activity puts our new knowledge of the derivatives of <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> to work.</p>

    <activity xml:id="A_2.2.3">
      <p>Answer each of the following questions. Where a derivative is requested, be sure to label the derivative function with its name using proper notation.

          <li><p>The exact slope of the tangent line to <m>y = f(x) = 2x + \frac{\sin(x)}{2}</m> at <m>x = \frac{\pi}{6}</m> is given by <m>f'(\frac{\pi}{6})</m>.  So, we first compute <m>f'(x)</m>.  Using the sum and constant multiple rules, <m>f'(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos(x)</m>, and thus <m>f'(\frac{\pi}{6}) = 2 + \frac{1}{2} \cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) = 2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.</m></p></li>

          <li><p>The tangent line passes through the point <m>(\frac{\pi}{2}, g(\frac{\pi}{2}))</m> with slope <m>g'(\frac{\pi}{2})</m>.  We observe first that <m>g(\frac{\pi}{2}) = (\frac{\pi}{2})^2 + 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \frac{\pi^2}{4}</m>.  Next, we compute the derivative function, <m>g'(x)</m>, and find that
              <me>
                g'(x) = 2x - 2\sin(x).
              </me>
              Thus, <m>g(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} - 2 \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \pi - 1</m>.
	
	Hence the equation of the tangent line (in point-slope form) is given by
              <me>
                y - \frac{\pi^2}{4} = (\pi-1)(x-\frac{\pi}{2}).
              </me>
            </p></li>

          <li><p>Noting that <m>\sin(\frac{\pi}{2})</m> is a constant, we have <m>p'(z) = 4z^3 + 4^z \ln(4) - 4\sin(z)</m>.</p></li>

          <li><p>The value of <m>P'(2)</m> will tell us the instantaneous rate of change of <m>P</m> at the instant two decades have elapsed.  Observe that <m>P'(t) = 8\cos(t)</m>, and thus <m>P'(2) = 8\cos(2) \approx -3.329</m> hundred animals per decade.  This tells us that the instantaneous rate of change of <m>P</m> on January 1, 2030 is about <m>-3329</m> animals per decade, which tells us that the animal population is shrinking considerably at this point in time.  We might say that for whatever the population is on January 1, 2030, we expect that population to drop by about 3300 animals over the next ten years, provided the current population trend continues.</p></li>

          <p>In this exercise, we explore how the limit definition of the derivative more formally shows that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)</m>. Letting <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, note that the limit definition of the derivative tells us that
          <me>
            f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}.
          </me>

          <ol>
            <li><p>Recall the trigonometric identity for the sine of a sum of angles <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>: 
                 <m>\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</m>.  Use this identity and some algebra to show that
                <me>
                  f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)(\cos(h)-1) + \cos(x)\sin(h)}{h}.
                </me>
              </p></li>

            <li><p>Next, note that as <m>h</m> changes, <m>x</m> remains constant. Explain why it therefore makes sense to say that
                <me>
                  f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) -1 }{h} + \cos(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}.
                </me>
              </p></li>

            <li><p>Finally, use small values of <m>h</m> to estimate the values of the two limits in (c):
                <me>
                  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) - 1}{h} \ \ \mbox{and}  \ \ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}.
                </me>
              </p></li>

            <li><p>What do your results in (c) thus tell you about <m>f'(x)</m>?</p></li>

            <li><p>By emulating the steps taken above, use the limit definition of the derivative to argue convincingly that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x).</m></p></li>
