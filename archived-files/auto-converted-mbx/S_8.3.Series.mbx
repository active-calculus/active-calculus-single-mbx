    <p>In <xref ref="S_8.2.Geometric">Section</xref>, we encountered several situations where we naturally considered an infinite sum of numbers called a geometric series. For example, by writing
      <me>
        N = 0.1212121212 \cdots = \frac{12}{100} + \frac{12}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{100} + \frac{12}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{100^2} + \cdots
      </me>
      as a geometric series, we found a way to write the repeating decimal expansion of <m>N</m> as a single fraction: <m>N = \frac{4}{33}</m>. There are many other situations in mathematics where infinite sums of numbers arise, but often these are not geometric. In this section, we begin exploring these other types of infinite sums. <xref ref="PA_8.3">Preview Activity</xref> provides a context in which we see how one such sum is related to the famous number <m>e</m>.</p>

    <exploration xml:id="PA_8.3">
      <p>Have you ever wondered how your calculator can produce a numeric approximation for complicated numbers like <m>e</m>, <m>\pi</m> or <m>\ln(2)</m>? After all, the only operations a calculator can really perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the operations that make up polynomials. This activity provides the first steps in understanding how this process works. Throughout the activity, let <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.

      <ol>
        <li><p>Find the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>x=0</m> and use this linearization to approximate <m>e</m>.  That is, find a formula <m>L(x)</m> for the tangent line, and compute <m>L(1)</m>, since <m>L(1) \approx f(1) = e</m>.
          <solution>
            <p>The linearization of <m>f</m> at <m>x=a</m> is
              <me>
                f(a) + f'(a)(x-a),
              </me>
              so the linearization <m>P_1(x)</m> of <m>f(x) = e^x</m> at <m>x=0</m> is
              <me>
                P_1(x) = e^0 + e^0(x-0) = 1+x.
              </me>
            </p>

            <p>Now
              <me>
                f(x) \approx P_1(x)
              </me>
              for <m>x</m> close to <m>0</m> and so
              <me>
                e = e^1 \approx P_1(1) = 1+1 = 2.
              </me>
            </p>
          </solution>
          </p></li>

        <li><p>The linearization of <m>e^x</m> does not provide a good approximation to <m>e</m> since 1 is not very close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach a bit. Instead of using a straight line to approximate <m>e</m>, we put an appropriate bend in our estimating function to make it better fit the graph of <m>e^x</m> for <m>x</m> close to 0. With the linearization, we had both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>f'(x)</m> share the same value as the linearization at <m>x=0</m>. We will now use a quadratic approximation <m>P_2(x)</m> to <m>f(x) = e^x</m> centered at <m>x=0</m> which has the property that <m>P_2(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>P'_2(0) = f'(0)</m>, \text{ and }  <m>P''_2(0) = f''(0)</m>.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>(i)</title>
            <p>Let <m>P_2(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}</m>. Show that <m>P_2(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>P'_2(0) = f'(0)</m>, and <m>P''_2(0) = f''(0)</m>. Then, use <m>P_2(x)</m> to approximate <m>e</m> by observing that <m>P_2(1) \approx f(1)</m>.
            <solution>
              <p>The derivatives of <m>P_2</m> and <m>f</m> are
                <md>
                  <mrow>P_2(x) \amp = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2} \amp  f(x) \amp = e^x</mrow>
                  <mrow>P'_2(x) \amp = 1 + x \amp  f'(x) \amp = e^x</mrow>
                  <mrow>P''_2(x) \amp = 1 \amp  f''(x) \amp = e^x,</mrow>
                </md>
                and so the derivatives of <m>P_2</m> and <m>f</m> evaluated at 0 are
                <md>
                  <mrow>P_2(0) \amp = 1 \amp  f(0) \amp = e^0 = 1</mrow>

                </md>
              </p>

              <p>Then
                <me>
                  e = e^1 \approx P_2(1) = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5.

          <li>
            <title>(ii)</title>
            <p>We can continue approximating <m>e</m> with polynomials of larger degree whose higher derivatives agree with those of <m>f</m> at 0. This turns out to make the polynomials fit the graph of <m>f</m> better for more values of <m>x</m> around 0. For example, let <m>P_3(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6}</m>. Show that <m>P_3(0) = f(0)</m>, <m>P'_3(0) = f'(0)</m>, <m>P''_3(0) = f''(0)</m>, and <m>P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)</m>. Use <m>P_3(x)</m> to approximate <m>e</m> in a way similar to how you did so with <m>P_2(x)</m> above.
            <solution>
              <p>The derivatives of <m>P_3</m> and <m>f</m> are
                <md>
                  <mrow>P_3(x) \amp = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6} \amp  f(x) \amp = e^x</mrow>

                  <mrow>P'''_3(x) \amp = 1  \amp  f'''(x) \amp = e^x,</mrow>
                </md>
                and so the derivatives of <m>P_2</m> and <m>f</m> evaluated at 0 are
                <md>
                  <mrow>P_3(0) \amp = 1 \amp  f(0) \amp = e^0 = 1</mrow>

              </p>

              <p>Then
                <me>
                  e = e^1 \approx P_3(1) = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67.

    <p><xref ref="PA_8.3">Preview Activity</xref> shows that an approximation to <m>e</m> using a linear polynomial is 2, an approximation to <m>e</m> using a quadratic polynomial is <m>2.5</m>, and an approximation using a cubic polynomial is 2.6667. As we will see later, if we continue this process we can obtain approximations from quartic (degree 4), quintic (degree 5), and higher degree polynomials giving us the following approximations to <m>e</m>:</p>

    <p>We see an interesting pattern here. The number <m>e</m> is being approximated by the sum
      <men xml:id="eq_8.3_e_n" >
        1+1+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{120} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!}
      </men>
      for increasing values of <m>n</m>.
      And just as we did with Riemann sums, we can use the summation notation as a shorthand<fn>Note that <m>0!</m> appears in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_8.3_e" />.  By definition, <m>0! = 1</m>.</fn> for writing the sum in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_8.3_e_n" /> so that
      <men xml:id="eq_8.3_e" >
        e \approx 1+1+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{120} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!} = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!}.
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>We can calculate this sum using as large an <m>n</m> as we want, and the larger <m>n</m> is the more accurate the approximation <xref ref="eq_8.3_e" /> is. Ultimately, this argument shows that we can write the number <m>e</m> as the infinite sum
      <men xml:id="eq_8.3_e_infinite" >
        e = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}.
      </men>
    </p>

    <p>This sum is an example of a <em>series</em><index><main>series</main></index> (or an <em>infinite series</em><index><main>infinite series</main></index>). Note that the series<nbsp /><xref ref="eq_8.3_e_infinite" /> is the sum of the terms of the (infinite) sequence <m>\left\{\frac{1}{n!}\right\}</m>. In general, we use the following notation and terminology.</p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>An <term>infinite series</term> of real numbers is the sum of the entries in an infinite sequence of real numbers. In other words, an infinite series is sum of the form
          <me>
            a_1+a_2+ \cdots + a_n + \cdots = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k,
          </me>
          where <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, are real numbers.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>We will normally use summation notation to identify a series. If the series adds the entries of a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n \geq 1}</m>, then we will write the series as
      <me>
        \sum_{k \geq 1} a_k
      </me>
      or
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Note well: each of these notations is simply shorthand for the infinite sum <m>a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n + \cdots</m>.</p>

    <p>Is it even possible to sum an infinite list of numbers? This question is one whose answer shouldn't come as a surprise. After all, we have used the definite integral to add up continuous (infinite) collections of numbers, so summing the entries of a sequence might be even easier. Moreover, we have already examined the special case of geometric series in the previous section. The next activity provides some more insight into how we make sense of the process of summing an infinite list of numbers.</p>

    <activity xml:id="x8.3.Act1">
      <p>Consider the series
        <me>
          \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>While it is physically impossible to add an infinite collection of numbers, we can, of course, add any finite collection of them. In what follows, we investigate how understanding how to find the <m>n</m>th partial sum (that is, the sum of the first <m>n</m> terms) enables us to make sense of the infinite sum.

    <p>The example in <xref ref="x8.3.Act1">Activity</xref> illustrates how we define the sum of an infinite series. We can add up the first <m>n</m> terms of the series to obtain a new sequence of numbers (called the <em>sequence of partial sums</em><index><main>partial sum</main></index><index><main>sequence of partial sums</main></index>). Provided that sequence converges, the corresponding infinite series is said to converge, and we say that we can find the sum of the series.</p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>The <term><m>n</m>th partial sum</term> of the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m>
          is the finite sum
          <m>S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k.</m></p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>In other words, the <m>n</m>th partial sum <m>S_n</m> of a series is the sum of the first <m>n</m> terms in the series, or
      <me>
        S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>We then investigate the behavior of a given series by examining the sequence
      <me>
        S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n, \ldots
      </me>
      of its partial sums. If the sequence of partial sums converges to some finite number, then we say that the corresponding series <em>converges</em><index><main>series</main><sub>converges</sub></index>. Otherwise, we say the series <em>diverges</em><index><main>series</main><sub>diverges</sub></index>. From our work in <xref ref="x8.3.Act1">Activity</xref>, the series
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}
      </me>
      appears to converge to some number near 1.54977. We formalize the concept of convergence and divergence of an infinite series in the following definition.</p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>The infinite series
          <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k
          </me>
        </p>

        <p><term>converges</term> (or is <term>convergent</term>) if the sequence <m>\{S_n\}</m> of partial sums converges, where
          <me>
            S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>If <m>\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = S</m>, then we call <m>S</m> the sum of the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m>. That is,
          <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = S.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>If the sequence of partial sums does not converge, then the series
          <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k
          </me>
        </p>

        <p><term>diverges</term> (or is <term>divergent</term>).</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>The early terms in a series do not contribute to whether or not the series converges or diverges. Rather, the convergence or divergence of a series
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k
      </me>
      is determined by what happens to the terms <m>a_k</m> for very large values of <m>k</m>. To see why, suppose that <m>m</m> is some constant larger than 1. Then
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k = (a_1+a_2+ \cdots + a_m) + \sum_{k=m+1}^{\infty} a_k.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Since <m>a_1+a_2+ \cdots + a_m</m> is a finite number, the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m> will converge if and only if the series <m>\sum_{k=m+1}^{\infty} a_k</m> converges. Because the starting index of the series doesn't affect whether the series converges or diverges, we will often just write
      <me>
        \sum a_k
      </me>
      when we are interested in questions of convergence/divergence and not necessarily the exact sum of a series.</p>

    <p>In <xref ref="S_8.2.Geometric">Section</xref> we encountered the special family of infinite geometric series whose convergence or divergence we completely determined. Recall that a geometric series is a special series of the form <m>\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers (and <m>r \ne 1</m>). We found that the <m>n</m>th partial sum <m>S_n</m> of a geometric series is given by the convenient formula
      <me>
        S_n = \frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r},
      </me>
      and thus a geometric series converges if <m>|r| \lt  1</m>. Geometric series diverge for all other values of <m>r</m>. While we have completely determined the convergence or divergence of geometric series, it is generally a difficult question to determine if a given nongeometric series converges or diverges. There are several tests we can use that we will consider in the following sections.</p>

    <p><em>Note well:</em> be very careful with the Divergence Test. This test only tells us what happens to a series if the terms of the corresponding sequence do not converge to 0.

    <p>The Divergence Test settles the questions of divergence or convergence of series <m>\sum a_k</m> in which <m>\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k \neq 0</m>. Determining the convergence or divergence of series <m>\sum a_k</m> in which <m>\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0</m> turns out to be more complicated. Often, we have to investigate the sequence of partial sums or apply some other technique.</p>

    <p>As an example, consider the <em>harmonic</em><index><main>harmonic series</main></index> series<fn>This series is called harmonic because each term in the series after the first is the harmonic mean of the term  before it and the term after it. The harmonic mean of two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is <m>\frac{2ab}{a+b}</m>. See ``What's Harmonic about the Harmonic Series", by David E.

    <p>This information doesn't seem to be enough to tell us if the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}</m> converges or diverges. The partial sums could eventually level off to some fixed number or continue to grow without bound. Even if we look at larger partial sums, such as <m>\sum_{n=1}^{1000} \frac{1}{k} \approx 7.485470861</m>, the result doesn't particularly sway us one way or another. The Integral Test is one way to determine whether or not the harmonic series converges, and we explore this further in the next activity.</p>

          <li><p>Letting Since <m>f</m> is decreasing, the improper integral <m>\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \ dx</m> is smaller than the limit of the Riemann sums as <m>n</m> goes to infinity.

              <me>
                \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} > \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \ dx.
              </me>
            </p></li>

          <li><p>We can evaluate the improper integral as follows:
              <md>
                <mrow>\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx \amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{1}{x} \ dx</mrow>

              </md>
              Since the value of the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}</m> exceeds the value of the infinite improper integral, we must conclude that the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}</m> diverges.</p></li>

    <p>The ideas from <xref ref="x8.3.Act4">Activity</xref> hold more generally. Suppose that <m>f</m> is a continuous decreasing function and that <m>a_k = f(k)</m> for each value of <m>k</m>. Consider the corresponding series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m>. The partial sum
      <me>
        S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k
      </me>
      can always be viewed as a left hand Riemann sum of <m>f(x)</m> using rectangles with heights given by the values <m>a_k</m> and bases of length 1. A representative picture is shown at left in <xref ref="F_8.3.Integral_Test">Figure</xref>. Since <m>f</m> is a decreasing function, we have that
      <me>
        S_n > \int_1^n f(x) \ dx.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Taking limits as <m>n</m> goes to infinity shows that
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k > \int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Therefore, if the improper integral <m>\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx</m> diverges, so does the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m>.</p>

    <figure xml:id="F_8.3.Integral_Test" >
      <caption>Comparing an improper integral to a series</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/8_3_Integral_test1" />
      <image width="73%" source="images/8_3_Integral_test2" />
    </figure>

    <p>What's more, if we look at the right hand Riemann sums of <m>f</m> on <m>[1,n]</m> as shown at right in <xref ref="F_8.3.Integral_Test">Figure</xref>, we see that
      <me>
        \int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx >  \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} a_k.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>So if <m>\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx</m> converges, then so does <m>\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} a_k</m>, which also means that the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m> converges. Our preceding discussion has demonstrated the truth of the Integral Test<index><main>integral test</main></index>.</p>

    <p><em>The Integral Test. </em> Let <m>f</m> be a real valued function and assume <m>f</m> is decreasing and positive for all <m>x</m> larger than some number <m>c</m>. Let <m>a_k = f(k)</m> for each positive integer <m>k</m>.

    <ol>
      <li><p>If the improper integral <m>\int_{c}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx</m> converges, then the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m> converges.</p></li>

      <li><p>If the improper integral <m>\int_{c}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx</m> diverges, then the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k</m> diverges.</p></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Note that the Integral Test compares a given infinite series to a natural, corresponding improper integral and basically says that the infinite series and corresponding improper integral both have the same convergence status.

    <title>The Limit Comparison Test</title>
    <p><index><main>limit comparison test</main></index></p>

    <p>The Integral Test allows us to determine the convergence of an entire family of series: the <m>p</m>-series. However, we have seen that it is, in general, difficult to integrate functions, so the Integral Test is not one that we can use all of the time. In fact, even for a relatively simple series like <m>\sum \frac{k^2+1}{k^4+2k+2}</m>, the Integral Test is not an option. In this section we will develop a test that we can use to apply to series of rational functions like this by comparing their behavior to the behavior of <m>p</m>-series.</p>

    <activity xml:id="x8.3.Act6">
      <p>Consider the series <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m>. Since the convergence or divergence of a series only depends on the behavior of the series for large values of <m>k</m>, we might examine the terms of this series more closely as <m>k</m> gets large.

      <ol>
        <li><p>By computing the value of <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> for <m>k = 100</m> and <m>k = 1000</m>, explain why the terms <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> are essentially <m>\frac{k}{k^3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.</p></li>

          <li><p>When <m>k</m> is very large, the constant 1 in the numerator is negligible compared to <m>k</m> and the constant 2 in the denominator is negligible compared to <m>k^3</m>.

          <li><p>Note that

                <mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{k+1}{k^3+2} }{ \frac{k}{k^3} }</mrow>

              This tells us that <m>a_k \approx b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>, which is what we suggested in part (a).</p></li>

          <li><p>Since <m>\frac{k}{k^3} = \frac{1}{k^2}</m>, the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3}</m> is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p=2</m> and so converges. Since <m>a_k \approx b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>, it seems reasonable to expect that <m>\sum a_k \approx \sum b_k</m> for large <m>k</m>s. Since <m>\sum a_k</m> is finite, we should then conclude that <m>\sum b_k</m> is also finite. So <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> should be a convergent series.</p></li>

    <p><xref ref="x8.3.Act6">Activity</xref> illustrates how we can compare one series with positive terms to another whose behavior (that is, whether the series converges or diverges) we know. More generally, suppose we have two series <m>\sum a_k</m> and <m>\sum b_k</m> with positive terms and we know the behavior of the series <m>\sum a_k</m>. Recall that the convergence or divergence of a series depends only on what happens to the terms of the series for large values of <m>k</m>, so if we know that <m>a_k</m> and <m>b_k</m> are essentially proportional to each other for large <m>k</m>, then the two series <m>\sum a_k</m> and <m>\sum b_k</m>
      should behave the same way. In other words, if there is a positive finite constant <m>c</m> such that
      <me>
        \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{b_k}{a_k} = c,
      </me>
      then <m>b_k \approx ca_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>. So
      <me>
        \sum b_k \approx \sum ca_k = c  \sum a_k.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Since multiplying by a nonzero constant does not affect the convergence or divergence of a series, it follows that the series <m>\sum a_k</m> and <m>\sum b_k</m> either both converge or both diverge. The formal statement of this fact is called the Limit Comparison Test.</p>

    <p><em>The Limit Comparison Test.</em> Let <m>\sum a_k</m> and <m>\sum b_k</m> be series with positive terms. If
      <me>
        \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{b_k}{a_k} = c
      </me>
      for some positive (finite) constant <m>c</m>, then <m>\sum a_k</m> and <m>\sum b_k</m>
      either both converge or both diverge.</p>

    <p>In essence, the Limit Comparison Test shows that if we have a series <m>\sum \frac{p(k)}{q(k)}</m> of rational functions where <m>p(k)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>m</m> and <m>q(k)</m> a polynomial of degree <m>l</m>, then the series <m>\sum \frac{p(k)}{q(k)}</m> will behave like the series <m>\sum \frac{k^m}{k^l}</m>. So this test allows us to quickly and easily determine the convergence or divergence of series whose summands are rational functions.</p>

      The Limit Comparison Test works well if we can find a series with known behavior to compare. But such series are not always easy to find.

          <li><p>The calculations in the table in part (a) seem to indicate that the ratio <m>\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}</m> is roughly <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.</p></li>

So the series <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> is approximately geometric with ratio <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large. Since the series <m>\sum \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k</m> converges because the ratio is less than 1, we expect that the series <m>\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}</m> will also converge.</p></li>

    <p>We can generalize the argument in <xref ref="x8.3.Act8">Activity</xref> in the following way. Consider the series <m>\sum a_k.</m>
      If
      <me>
        \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \approx r
      </me>
      for large values of <m>k</m>, then <m>a_{k+1} \approx ra_k</m> for large <m>k</m> and the series <m>\sum a_k</m> is approximately the geometric series <m>\sum ar^k</m> for large <m>k</m>. Since the geometric series with ratio <m>r</m> converges only for <m>-1 \lt   r \lt  1</m>, we see that the series <m>\sum a_k</m>
      will converge if
      <me>
        \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} = r
      </me>
      for a value of <m>r</m> such that <m>|r| \lt  1</m>. This result is known as the Ratio Test.</p>

    <p><em>The Ratio Test. </em> Let <m>\sum a_k</m>
    be an infinite series. Suppose
    <me>
      \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{|a_{k+1}|}{|a_k|} = r.
    </me>

    <ol>
      <li><p>If <m>0 \leq r \lt  1</m>, then the series <m>\sum a_k</m> converges.</p></li>

      <li><p>If <m>1 \lt  r</m>, then the series <m>\sum a_k</m> diverges.</p></li>

      <li><p>If <m>r = 1</m>, then the test is inconclusive.</p></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p><em>Note well:</em> The Ratio Test takes a given series and looks at the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms; in so doing, the test is essentially asking, <q>is this series approximately geometric?</q> If the series can be thought of as essentially geometric, the test use the limiting common ratio to determine if the given series converges.</p>

    <p>We have now encountered several tests for determining convergence or divergence of series. The Divergence Test can be used to show that a series diverges, but never to prove that a series converges. We used the Integral Test to determine the convergence status of an entire class of series, the <m>p</m>-series. The Limit Comparison Test works well for series that involve rational functions and which can therefore by compared to <m>p</m>-series. Finally, the Ratio Test allows us to compare our series to a geometric series; it is particularly useful for series that involve <m>n</m>th powers and factorials. Two other tests, the Direct Comparison Test and the Root Test, are discussed in the exercises. Now it is time for some practice.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><p>Since <m>\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{2^n} = 0</m>, the Divergence Test does not apply. The Ratio Test is a good one to apply with series whose terms involve exponentials and polynomials.

              In this example we have <m>a_{n+1} = \frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}}</m> and <m>a_n = \frac{n}{2^n}</m>. So
              <me>
                \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \frac{\frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}}}{\frac{n}{2^n}} = \frac{n+1}{2n}.
              </me>
              As <m>n</m> goes to infinity, the fraction <m>\frac{n+1}{n}</m> goes to 1 and so
              <me>
                \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n+1}{2n} = \frac{1}{2}.
              </me>
              So in this example, for large <m>n</m> we have that <m>\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \approx \frac{1}{2}</m> or that <m>\sum a_n</m> is roughly a geometric series for large <m>n</m> with ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. Since geometric series with ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> converges, we can conclude that
              <me>
                \sum \frac{n}{2^n}
              </me>
              converges as well.</p></li>

          <li><p>For this series, notice that the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, so
              <me>
                \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^3+2}{n^2+1} = \infty.
              </me>
              Since this limit is not 0, the Divergence Test shows that <m>\sum \frac{k^3+2}{k^2+1}</m> diverges.</p></li>

          <li><p>We use the Ratio Test here with <m>a_k = \frac{10^k}{k!}</m>. Now
              <md>
                <mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{10^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} }{ \frac{10^k}{k!} }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{10^{k+1}(k!)}{10^k(k+1)!}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{10}{k+1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = 0,</mrow>
              </md>
              so the Ratio Test shows that <m>\sum \frac{10^k}{k!}</m> converges.</p></li>

          <li><p>If we ignore the highest powered terms, then the series <m>\sum \frac{k^3-2k^2+1}{k^6+4}</m> looks like the series <m>\sum \frac{k^3}{k^6} = \sum \frac{1}{k^3}</m>. We formally apply the Limit Comparison Test as follows:
              <md>
                <mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{k^3-2k^2+1}{k^6+4} }{  \frac{1}{k^3} } \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k^6-2k^5+k^3}{k^6+4}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1 - \frac{2}{k} + \frac{1}{k^3}}{1 + \frac{4}{k^6}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  1.</mrow>
              </md>
              Since <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^3}</m> is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p=3>1</m>, the series <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^3}</m> converges. Consequently, the Limit Comparison Test shows that <m>\sum \frac{k^3-2k^2+1}{k^6+4}</m> converges as well.</p></li>

              <solution>
              <p><em>Solution.</em> We use the Ratio Test with <m>a_n = \frac{10^n}{n!}</m>. First we consider the ratios of successive terms:

        <statement>
          <p>There is a test for convergence similar to the Ratio Test called the <em>Root Test</em>. Suppose we have a series <m>\sum a_k</m> of positive terms so that <m>a_n \to 0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.

              <solution>
              <p>If <m>\sqrt[n]{a_n} \to r</m>, then as <m>n</m> increases we know that <m>\sqrt[n]{a_n} \approx r</m>. So for large <m>n</m> we have <m>a_n \approx r^n</m>.</p>

              <solution>
              <p>Since the terms in our series are all positive, we must have <m>r > 0</m>. Now the geometric series with ratio <m>r</m> converges only for <m>r \lt  1</m>,so the series

        <statement>
          <p>In the Limit Comparison Test we compared the behavior of a series to one whose behavior we know. In that test we use the limit of the ratio of corresponding terms of the series to determine if the comparison is valid. In this exercise we see how we can compare two series directly, term by term, without using a limit of sequence. First we consider an example.</p>

          <ol>
          <li><p>Consider the series
            <me>
              \sum \frac{1}{k^2}  \text{ and }   \sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}.
            </me>
            We know that the series <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p = 2 > 1</m> and so <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> converges. In this part of the exercise we will see how to use information about <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> to determine information about <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m>. Let <m>a_k = \frac{1}{k^2}</m> and <m>b_k = \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <title>(i)</title>
              <p>Let <m>S_n</m> be the <m>n</m>th partial sum of <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> and <m>T_n</m> the <m>n</m>th partial sum of <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m>. Which is larger, <m>S_1</m> or <m>T_1</m>? Why?
              <solution>
              <p>Since <m>S_1 = 1</m> and <m>T_1 = \frac{1}{2}</m>, we see that <m>S_1 > T_1</m>.</p>
              </solution>

            <li>
              <title>(ii)</title>
              <p>Recall that

              </me>
              Which is larger, <m>a_2</m> or <m>b_2</m>? Based on that answer, which is larger, <m>S_2</m> or <m>T_2</m>?
              <solution>
              <p>Since <m>a_2 = \frac{1}{4}</m> and <m>b_2 = \frac{1}{6}</m>, it is the case that <m>a_2 > b_2</m>. We already know that <m>S_1 > T_1</m>, so adding a larger number to <m>S_1</m> than we add to <m>T_1</m> makes <m>S_2 > T_2</m>.</p>

              <p>Recall that

                S_3 = S_2 + a_3  \text{ and }   T_3 = T_2 + b_3.
              </me>
              Which is larger, <m>a_3</m> or <m>b_3</m>? Based on that answer, which is larger, <m>S_3</m> or <m>T_3</m>?
              <solution>
              <p>Since <m>a_3 = \frac{1}{9}</m> and <m>b_3 = \frac{1}{12}</m>, it is the case that <m>a_3 > b_3</m>. We already know that <m>S_2 > T_2</m>, so adding a larger number to <m>S_2</m> than we add to <m>T_2</m> makes <m>S_3 > T_3</m>.</p>

              <p>Which is larger, <m>a_n</m> or <m>b_n</m>? Explain. Based on that answer, which is larger, <m>S_n</m> or <m>T_n</m>?
              <solution>
              <p>Since <m>n^2+n > n^2</m> when <m>n</m> is positive, we have <m>\frac{1}{n^2} > \frac{1}{n^2+n}</m> or <m>a_n > b_n</m>. So at each step, we are adding larger numbers to the partial sums of <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> than we are to the partial sums of <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m>, we conclude that <m>S_n > T_n</m>.</p>

            <li>
              <title>(v)</title>
              <p>Based on your response to the previous part of this exercise, what relationship do you expect there to be between <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> and  <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m>? Do you expect <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m> to converge or diverge? Why?
              <solution>
              <p>Since <m>S_n > T_n</m>, we should expect <m>\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n > \lim_{n \to \infty} T_n</m> or
                <me>
                  \sum \frac{1}{k^2} >  \sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}.
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>Since <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p=2 > 1</m>, we know that <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m> converges (and is finite). Now <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m> is a sum of positive terms and is therefore positive, and is also less than a finite number (<m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2}</m>), so we expect that <m>\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}</m> converges as well.</p>
              </solution>
              </p></li>
          </ul>
          </li>

          <li><p>The example in the previous part of this exercise illustrates a more general result. Explain why the Direct Comparison Test, stated here, works.
    

            \text{ 
            <em>The Direct Comparison Test. </em> If
            <me>
              0 \leq b_k \leq a_k
            </me>
            for every \(k\), then we must have
            <me>
              0 \leq \sum b_k \leq \sum a_k
            </me>
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><p>If \(\sum a_k\) converges, then \(\sum b_k\) converges.</p></li>

            <li><p>If \(\sum b_k\) diverges, then \(\sum a_k\) diverges.</p></li>
          </ol>
          } 

           <em>Important Note:</em> This comparison test applies only to series with nonnegative terms.
          <solution>
          <p>If we have two series <m>\sum a_k</m> and <m>\sum b_k</m> of positive terms with <m>a_k \geq b_k</m> for every <m>k</m>, then
            <me>
              \sum a_k \geq \sum b_k > 0.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>Now if <m>\sum b_k</m> diverges, then <m>\sum b_k</m> is infinite. Anything larger must also be infinite and so <m>\sum a_k</m> must also diverge. On the other hand, if <m>\sum a_k</m> is convergent (that is, finite), then anything smaller and positive must also be finite and so <m>\sum b_k</m> must also converge.</p>

              <p>Use the Direct Comparison Test to determine the convergence or divergence of the series <m>\sum \frac{1}{k-1}</m>. Hint: Compare to the harmonic series.
              <solution>
              <p>For any <m>k</m> we have <m>k > k-1</m>, so if <m>k > 1</m> then it follows that <m>0 \lt  \frac{1}{k} \lt  \frac{1}{k-1}</m>. Since the harmonic series <m>\sum \frac{1}{k}</m> diverges, the Direct Comparison Test shows that the larger series <m>\sum \frac{1}{k-1}</m> must also diverge.</p>
              </solution>

            <li>
              <title>(ii)</title>
              <p>Use the Direct Comparison Test to determine the convergence or divergence of the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3+1}</m>.
              <solution>
              <p>In this case we know that <m>k^3 \lt  k^3+1</m> and so if <m>k > 0</m> then <m>\frac{1}{k^3} > \frac{1}{k^3+1}</m>. It follows that <m>\frac{k}{k^3} > \frac{k}{k^3+1}</m> and so the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3+1}</m> is bounded below by 0 and above by the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3}</m>. Now
                <me>
                  \frac{k}{k^3} = \frac{1}{k^2}
                </me>
                and so the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3}</m> is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p=2</m> and converges. The Direct Comparison Test shows that the smaller series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3+1}</m> must also converge.</p>
