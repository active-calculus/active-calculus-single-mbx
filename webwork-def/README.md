# WeBWorK definition files

In this folder you will find the definition files for all the webwork problems in the 2018 (Updated Edition) of Active Calculus. For newer versions, you can use the python code found in `webwork_scraper.py`. This script uses the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) package. 

The code skips Section 4.4 as those problems are hard coded into the book. Hence the definition file for Section 4.4 was written manually. Also, Sections 2.2 and 3.3 do not have webwork problems, so there are not definition files. These are items to keep in mind for use with later versions of Active Calculus.
