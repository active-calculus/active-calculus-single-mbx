<statement>
<p>In each of the following questions, draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described, as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis. In addition, draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice, along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid. It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find. For each prompt, use the finite region <m>S</m> in the first quadrant bounded by the curves <m>y = 2x</m> and <m>y = x^3</m>.

        <ol label="a">
          <li><p>The two curves intersect in the first quadrant at <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})</m>.  Revolving the region <m>S</m> about the line <m>y = -2</m>, we see that a typical slice is a washer with thickness <m>\triangle x</m>, outer radius <m>R(x) = 2x + 2</m>, and inner radius <m>r(x) = x^3 + 2</m>.  It follows by the washer method that
          <me>V = \int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}} \pi ( (2x+2)^2 - (x^3 + 2)^2 ) \, dx = \frac{4}{21}(21+8\sqrt{2}) \pi \approx 19.336.</me>
          </p></li>
          <li><p>In this situation, revolving about <m>y = 4</m>, we see that the outer radius of a typical washer is <m>R(x) = 4 - x^3</m>, while the inner radius is <m>r(x) = 4 - 2x</m>, and thus the volume is
          <me>V = \int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}} \pi ( (4 - x^3)^2 - (4-2x)^2 ) \, dx =  \left( 8-\frac{32\sqrt{2}}{21} \right)\pi \approx 18.3626.</me>
          </p></li>
          <li><p>Because we are revolving about <m>x = -1</m>, when we slice perpendicular to this we get washers of thickness <m>\triangle y</m>, and thus we need to write the two curves as functions of <m>y</m> in order to determine the radii of the slices as functions of <m>y</m>, we note that the line can be expressed as <m>x = \frac{1}{2}y</m> and the cubic curve can be rewritten in the form <m>x = y^{1/3}.</m>  The outer radius of a typical slice is thus <m>R(y) = y^{1/3} + 1</m> and the inner radius is <m>r(y) = \frac{1}{2}y + 1</m>.  It follows that the volume of the solid is
            <me>V = \int_{0}^{2\sqrt{2}} \pi( (y^{1/3} + 1)^2 - (\frac{1}{2}y + 1)^2 ) \, dy = \frac{2}{15}(15 + 8\sqrt{2}) \pi \approx 11.022.</me>
          </p></li>
          <li><p>Here, the outer radius is <m>R(y) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}y</m> and the inner radius is <m>r(y) = 5 - y^{1/3}</m>, so the total volume of the solid is
          <me>V = \int_{0}^{2\sqrt{2}} \pi( (5 - \frac{1}{2}y)^2 - (5 - y^{1/3})^2 ) \, dy = \frac{2}{15}(75-8\sqrt{2})\pi \approx 26.677.</me>
