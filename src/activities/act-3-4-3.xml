      Consider the region in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane that is bounded by the <m>x</m>-axis and the function <m>f(x) = 25-x^2</m>.
      Construct a rectangle whose base lies on the <m>x</m>-axis and is centered at the origin,
      and whose sides extend vertically until they intersect the curve <m>y = 25-x^2</m>.
      Which such rectangle has the maximum possible area?
      Which such rectangle has the greatest perimeter?
      Which has the greatest combined perimeter and area? (Challenge:
      answer the same questions in terms of positive parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> for the function <m>f(x) = b-ax^2</m>.)

      Let <m>x</m> represent half the width of the rectangle's base.

      Maximum area:

      At <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{82}-1}{3}</m> the absolute maximum of combined perimeter and area occurs.

  </answer>
  <solution permid="KUr">
    <p permid="DpS">
      Letting <m>x</m> represent half the width of the rectangle's base,
      it follows that the rectangle's height is <m>25-x^2</m>.
      Hence the area of the rectangle is
      <me permid="Avm">
        A(x) = 2x(25-x^2) = 50x - 2x^3
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="jxb">
      Based on the region,
      the only possible values of <m>x</m> are for <m>0 \le x \le 5</m>;
      moreover, it is evident that for either <m>x = 0</m> or <m>x = 5</m>,
      the area of the corresponding rectangle is zero,
      which can't be where the maximum occurs.
      Differentiating,
      <me permid="gCv">
        A'(x) = 50 - 6x^2
      </me>,
      so we find the critical number of <m>A</m> by solving <m>6x^2 = 50</m>,
      which yields <m>x = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 2.8868</m>,
      which results in the maximum possible area of
      <me permid="MJE">
        A(\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}) = \frac{500}{9}\sqrt{3} \approx 96.225
      </me>
      square units.
    </p>

    <p permid="PEk">
      To maximize perimeter, we note that the rectangle's perimeter is
      <me permid="sQN">
        P(x) = 2x + (25-x^2) + 2x + (25 - x^2) = -2x^2 + 4x + 50
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="vLt">
      It is straightforward to show that the only critical number of the quadratic function <m>P</m> occurs when <m>x = 1</m> and that the corresponding absolute maximum value is <m>P(1) = 52</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="bSC">
      Finally, to consider combined area and perimeter,
      examine the function <m>f(x) = A(x) + P(x)</m> on the interval <m>0 \le x \le 5</m>.
      You should find that the only relevant critical number is
      <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{82}-1}{3}</m> and that the absolute maximum of <m>f</m> occurs at that value.
