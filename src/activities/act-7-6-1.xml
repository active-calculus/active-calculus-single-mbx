      Our first model will be based on the following assumption:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>The rate of change of the population is proportional to the population. </em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      On the face of it, this seems pretty reasonable.
      When there is a relatively small number of people,
      there will be fewer births and deaths so the rate of change will be small.
      When there is a larger number of people,
      there will be more births and deaths so we expect a larger rate of change.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>P(t)</m> is the population <m>t</m> years after the year 2000, we may
      express this assumption as
      <me>
        \frac{dP}{dt} = kP
      </me>
      where <m>k</m> is a constant of proportionality.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the data in the table to estimate the derivative <m>P'(0)</m> using a central difference.
            Assume that <m>t=0</m> corresponds to the year 2000.

        </li>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now that we know the value of <m>k</m>, we have the initial

            What does your solution predict for the population in the year 2010?
            Is this close to the actual population given in the table?

  <solution>
    <p>
      We let <m>P(t)</m> be the population after year 2000 with <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant of proportionality.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Using the data in the table,
            <me>
              P'(0) \approx \frac{P(1) - P(-1)}{2} \approx \frac{6.159 - 6.008}{2} \approx 0.0755.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>t = 0</m> corresponds to the year <m>2000</m>, <m>P(0) = 6.084</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Using <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</m> and the preceding values at <m>t = 0</m>, we have <m>0.0755 \approx k (6.084)</m>, so <m>k \approx 0.012041</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The solution for the initial value problem is <m>P(t) = 6.084 e^{0.012041t}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The year 2010 corresponds to <m>t = 10</m>.  So <m>P(10) \approx 6.8878</m>.  The model predicts that the population in 2010 will be about 6.888 billion.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The population will be 12 billion when <m>P(t) = 12</m>.  So we solve the equation <m>6.084e^{0.012041t} = 12</m> for <m>t</m>.  We see that <m>e^{0.012041t} = \frac{12}{6.084}</m>, so <m>t = \frac{1}{0.012041} \ln \left( \frac{12}{6.084}\right) \approx 56.41</m>.  The population will reach 12 billion during the year 2056.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The year 2500 corresponds to <m>t = 500</m>.  So <m>P(500) \approx 3012.3</m>.  The model predicts that the population in 2500 will be about 3012 billion or about about 3 012 300 000 000.  This is rather unreasonably large.
