  <statement>
    <p>
      A hiker starting at a point <m>P</m> on a straight road walks east towards point <m>Q</m>,
      which is on the road and 3 kilometers from point <m>P</m>.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
      <p>
        Two kilometers due north of point <m>Q</m> is a cabin.
        The hiker will walk down the road for a while,
        at a pace of 8 kilometers per hour.
        At some point <m>Z</m> between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,
        the hiker leaves the road and makes a straight line towards the cabin through the woods,
        hiking at a pace of 3 kph,
        as pictured in <xref ref="F-3-4-Act2">Figure</xref>.
        In order to minimize the time to go from <m>P</m> to <m>Z</m> to the cabin,
        where should the hiker turn into the forest?
      </p>

  <hint>
    <p>
      Let <m>x</m> be the distance from <m>Z</m> to <m>Q</m>.
      What is then the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>Z</m> in terms of <m>x</m>?
      How about the distance from <m>Z</m> to the cabin?
      How does time depend on distance and rate?
    </p>
  </hint>
  <answer>
    <p>
      The absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is <m>0.99302</m> hours,
      which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.
    </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We begin by letting <m>x</m> be the distance from <m>Z</m> to <m>Q</m>.
      Since it is 3 km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>,
      the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>Z</m> is <m>3-x</m>.
      Further, by the Pythagorean Theorem,
      the distance from <m>Z</m> to the cabin is <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of <m>x</m>.
      Because distance equals rate times time,
      time is thus distance divided by rate.
      Along the road,
      the hiker's distance is <m>3-x</m> km and her rate is <m>8</m> km/hr,
      thus her time on the road, <m>T_r</m> is
      <me>
        T_r = \frac{3-x}{8}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once she enters the woods,
      her rate drops to <m>3</m> km/hr and travels a distance of <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m> km,
      making her time in the woods, <m>T_w</m>, given by
      <me>
        T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the hiker's total time is given by the function
      <me>
        T(x) = \frac{3-x}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the only values of <m>x</m> that make sense to use are <m>0 \le x \le 3</m>
      (using either negative values or values greater than 3 clearly add unnecessary time to the trip),
      we use this domain for <m>T</m> and now seek the absolute minimum of <m>T</m> on <m>[0,3]</m>.
      First, we find that
      <me>
        T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (4+x^2)^{-1/2} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting <m>T'(x) = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>,
      we have <m>\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}</m>,
      so <m>8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}</m>.
      Squaring both sides, <m>64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2</m>.
      Hence, <m>55x^2 = 36</m>,
      so <m>x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.80904</m>. (We don't consider the critical number
      <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}</m> because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of <m>T</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we evaluate <m>T</m> at the only critical number in the interval and at the interval's endpoints.
      Doing so, we find <m>T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417</m>,
      <m>T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{3} \approx 1.20185</m>,
      and <m>T(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.99302</m>,
      and thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is <m>0.99302</m> hours,
      which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.
