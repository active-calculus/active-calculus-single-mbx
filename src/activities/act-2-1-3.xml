            Note that since <m>h(z) = z^{1/2} + z^{-1}</m>,
            we have <m>h'(z) = \frac{1}{2}z^{-1/2} - z^{-2}</m>.
            Thus,
            <m>h'(4) = \frac{1}{2(4)^{1/2}} - \frac{1}{4^2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{16}</m>.
            Thus, the slope of the tangent line to <m>h(z)</m> at the point where <m>z = 4</m> is <m>\frac{3}{16}</m>.

            For (i.), note that <m>P'(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37)</m>,
            and therefore <m>P'(4) = 2(1.37)^4 \ln(1.37) \approx 2.218</m> million cells per day.
            For (ii.), we can compute <m>P''(t)</m> and find that
            <m>P''(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37) \ln(1.37)</m> and therefore find that <m>P''(4) \approx 0.69825</m>.
            Since <m>P''(4)</m> is positive,
            this tells us that the instantaneous rate of change <m>P'(t)</m> is increasing at <m>t = 4</m>,
            and thus the population is growing at an increasing rate.

            Given <m>p(a) = 3a^4 - 2a^3 + 7a^2 - a + 12</m>,
            first observe that <m>p(-1) = 3 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 12 = 25</m>,
            so the tangent line will pass through <m>(-1,25)</m>.
            Further, since <m>p'(a) = 12a^3 - 6a^2 + 14a - 1</m>,
            we have <m>p'(-1) = -12 - 6 - 14 - 1 = -33</m>,
            which is the slope of the tangent line.
            The equation of the tangent line is therefore <m>y - 25 = -33(a+1)</m>.

            The biggest difference is that (a) asks for the
            <em>slope</em> of the tangent line,
            while (c) asks for the <em>equation</em> of the tangent line.
            The latter requires the slope of the tangent line,
            but the slope and equation are two different entities.
