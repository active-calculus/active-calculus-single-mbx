<statement>
<p>In each of the following problems, our goal is to determine the area of the region described. For each region, (i) determine the intersection points of the curves, (ii) sketch the region whose area is being found, (iii) draw and label a representative slice, and (iv) state the area of the representative slice. Then, state a definite integral whose value is the exact area of the region, and evaluate the integral to find the numeric value of the region's area.

        <ol label="a.">
          <li><p>By solving <m>\sqrt{x}=\frac{1}{4}x</m>, we see that the two curves intersect when <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=16</m>, so at the points <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(16,4)</m>.  We can plot the region as shown in the figure below.</p>
              <figure xml:id="F-6-1-act1a-soln" >

            </figure>
          <p>Slicing the region with thin vertical rectangles, we see that a typical rectangle's height is given by <m>\sqrt{x}-\frac{1}{4}x</m>, and thus the area of such a slice is <m>A_{\mbox{rect} } = (\sqrt{x} - \frac{1}{4}x) \triangle x</m>.  It follows that the area of the region bounded by the two curves is
          <me>
              A = \int_{0}^{16} (\sqrt{x} - \frac{1}{4}x) \, dx.
          </me>
          Evaluating the integral, we find <m>A = \frac{32}{3}</m>.
          </p></li>

          <li><p>Solving <m>12-2x^2=x^2-8</m>, we find that the two curves intersect where <m>3x^2=2-</m>, so at <m>x=\pm \sqrt{20/3}</m>.  We can plot the region as shown in the figure below.</p>

          <p>Slicing the region with thin vertical rectangles, a typical rectangle's height is given by <m>(12-x^2)-(x^2-8)</m>, and thus the area of such a slice is <m>A_{\mbox{rect} } = ((12-x^2)-(x^2-8)) \triangle x</m>.  Hence, the area of the region bounded by the two curves is
          <me>
              A = \int_{-\sqrt{20}/3}^{\sqrt{20}/3} ((12-x^2)-(x^2-8)) \, dx.

              <p>The first positive value at which the sine and cosine functions intersect is <m>x=\frac{\pi}{4}.</m> Plotting the functions in a surrounding region, we see the following figure.</p>

            <p>Slicing the region with vertical rectangles, we find the area of the shaded region is given by
            <me>
              A = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{4} \left( \cos(x) - \sin(x) \right) dx = \sqrt{2} - 1.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>The curves <m>y = x^3-x</m> and <m>y = x^2</m> intersect at three points, forming two regions.  Setting <m>x^3-x=x^2</m> and solving, we find that
            <me>x^3-x^2-x=x(x^2-x-1)=0,</me>
            which implies that <m>x=0</m> or <m>x = \frac{1}{2}(1 \pm \sqrt{5})</m>.  Plotting the curves, we see that for the left-hand region, the relative interval is <m>[\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2},0]</m> and <m>g(x)=x^3-x \gt x^2 = f(x)</m>.

            Thus, the left-hand region has area
            <me>
              A_1 = \int_{\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}}^0 \left( x^2 - \left(x^3 - x \right) \right) dx = \dfrac{13 + 5\sqrt{5}}{24} \approx 1.007514.
            </me>
            For the right-hand region, the interval is <m>[0, \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}]</m> and <m>f(x)=x^2 \gt x^3-x = g(x)</m>, so that its area is
            <me>
              A_2 = \int_0^{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}} \left( \left(x^3 - x \right) - x^2\right) dx = \dfrac{13 - 5\sqrt{5}}{24} \approx 0.075819.
