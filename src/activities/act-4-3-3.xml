      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            The curve <m>y = v(t) = \sqrt{4-(t-2)^2}</m> is the top half of the circle <m>(t-2)^2 + y^2 = 4</m>,
            which has radius 2 and is centered at <m>(2,0)</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Thus,
      the value of <m>\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt</m> is the area of a semicircle of radius 2, which is <m>\frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = 2\pi</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Because the velocity <m>v(t)</m> is always nonnegative in this problem,
            the meaning of <m>\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt = 2\pi</m> is both the distance traveled and the change in position of the object on the interval <m>0 \le t \le \pi</m>.
            Specifically, the object moved <m>2 \pi</m> meters in 4 minutes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We know <m>v_{\text{AVG} }[a,b] = \frac{1}{b-a}  \int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m>, so
            <me>
              v_{\text{AVG} }[0,4] = \frac{1}{4-0}  \int_0^4 \sqrt{4-(t-2)^2} \, dt = \frac{1}{4} 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{2}
            </me>,
            which is measured in meters per minute,
            since the units on <q>4</q>
            are minutes and on <q><m>2\pi</m></q> are meters.

        <li>
          <p>
            Constructing a figure similar to those shown in this section on the topic of average value of a function,
            we find the following,
            which demonstrates a rectangle having the same area as the semicircle.

          <p>
            The height of the rectangle is the average value of <m>v</m>,
            specifically <m>v_{\text{AVG} }[0,4] = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Knowing that average velocity is <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
            it follows from the fact that distance traveled equals average rate times time
            (provided velocity is always nonnegative),
            we have
            <me>
              D = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 4 = 2\pi
            </me>.
            We see from (c) or (f) that we are simply considering the situation from two different perspectives:
            if we know the distance traveled,
            we can find average velocity,
            or if we know average velocity,
            we can find distance traveled.
