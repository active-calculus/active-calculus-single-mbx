    <p>
      Consider a thin bar of length 20 cm whose density is distributed according to the function <m>\rho(x) = 4 + 0.1x</m>,
      where <m>x = 0</m> represents the left end of the bar.
      Assume that <m>\rho</m> is measured in g/cm and <m>x</m> is measured in cm.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Find the total mass, <m>M</m>, of the bar.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Without doing any calculations,
            do you expect the center of mass of the bar to be equal to 10,
            less than 10, or greater than 10?
            Why?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Compute <m>\overline{x}</m>,
            the exact center of mass of the bar.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            What is the average density of the bar?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now consider a different density function,
            given by <m>p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}</m>,
            also for a bar of length 20 cm whose left end is at <m>x = 0</m>.
            Plot both <m>\rho(x)</m> and <m>p(x)</m> on the same axes.
            Without doing any calculations,
            which bar do you expect to have the greater center of mass?
            Why?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Compute the exact center of mass of the bar described in (e) whose density function is <m>p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}</m>.
            Check the result against the prediction you made in (e).

        <li>

            Think about how the two density functions distribute mass.
            Note that they appear to distribute the same total mass,
            as the areas under the two curves appear to be equal.

        <li>
          <p>
            The center of mass will be greater than 10 since the mass is more concentrated as <m>x</m> increases.

        <li>
          <p>
            Using the formula we developed,
            <m>\overline{x} = \frac{\int_{0}^{20} x \rho(x) \, dx}{\int_{0}^{20} \rho(x) \, dx}</m>, so
            <me>
              \overline{x} = \frac{\int_{0}^{20} x (4 + 0.1x)) \, dx}{\int_{0}^{20} 4 + 0.1x \, dx} = \frac{\frac{3200}{3}}{100} = \frac{32}{3}
            </me>,
            which is indeed just greater than 10.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Recall that average density is given by mass divided by length,
            so since the bar is 20 cm long and its mass is 100 g, the average density is 100/20 = 5 g/cm.
            This can also be computed using the formula for average value of a function:
            <me>
              \rho_{\text{AVG} [0,20]} = \frac{1}{20-0} \int_{0}^{20} \rho(x) \,dx = \frac{100}{20}
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}</m> lies below
            <m>\rho(x) = 4 + 0.1x</m> up until where they intersect at about <m>17.53</m>,
            after which <m>p(x) \gt \rho(x)</m>,
            we see that <m>p(x)</m> distributes mass more to the right.
            It also appears as if the two curves may bound the same total area,
            and thus the generate the same total mass.
            If that is the case, we expect
            <m>\overline{x}</m> for <m>p(x)</m> to lie slightly to the right of the center of mass for <m>\rho(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We see that
            <me>
              \overline{x} = \frac{\int_{0}^{20} x 4e^{0.020732x} \, dx}{\int_{0}^{20} 4e^{0.020732x} \, dx} \approx 10.6891
            </me>,
            which is indeed slightly right of <m>\overline{x}</m> for <m>\rho(x)</m>.
