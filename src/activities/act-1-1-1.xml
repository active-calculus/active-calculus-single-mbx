              What is the meaning of the slope of this line?
              In light of this meaning,
              what is a geometric way to interpret each of the values computed in the preceding question?

              Then,
        zoom in repeatedly on the point <m>(0.8, s(0.8))</m>.
              What do you observe about how the graph appears as you view it more and more closely?

            On <m>[0.4,0.8]</m>,
            the average velocity is <m>AV_{[0.4,0.8]} = \frac{s(0.8)-s(0.4)}{0.8-0.4} = \frac{63.36-58.24}{0.4} = 12.8</m> ft/sec.

            This is precisely the average velocity of the ball between <m>t = 0.4</m> and <m>t = 0.8</m>,
            and indeed each of the average velocities computed in (a) can be viewed as the slope of the line joining the points <m>(a,s(a))</m> and <m>(b,s(b))</m>.

            Hence it appears that the ball's velocity at the instant <m>t = 0.8</m> should be about 6.4 feet per second.
