      In each of the following questions,
      draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described,
      as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis.
      In addition,
      draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice,
      along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid.
      It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find.

            Observe that horizontal slices with thickness

            each with radius given by
            <m>r(y) = y^2</m> since they are given by the curve <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m>,
            which can be equivalently expressed as <m>x = y^2</m>.
            The volume of each slice is thus

              V_{\text{slice}} = \pi r(y)^2 \Delta y = \pi y^4 \Delta y

            The volume of the solid is thus given by the definite integral
            <me permid="Slm">

            Slicing perpendicular to the axis of rotation,
            we get slices of thickness
            <m>\Delta y</m> that are shaped like washers.
            The outer radius, <m>R(y)</m>,
            is given by <m>R(y) = 4</m>;
            the innner radius is given by the function <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m>,
            but expressed with <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>,
            so <m>r(y) = y^2</m>.
            It follows that a representative washer slice has volume
            <me permid="ysv">

            Further,
            since <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m> and <m>x = 4</m> intersect at the point <m>(4,2)</m>,
            we integrate from <m>y = 0</m> to <m>y = 2</m> and thus find that the total volume is

            The two nonnegative values of <m>x</m> that make this equation true are <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=\sqrt{2}</m>,
            and thus the points <m>(0,0)</m> and
            <m>(\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})</m> form the boundaries of the region <m>S</m> that is being rotated about the <m>x</m>-axis.
            Since we rotate about the horizontal axis,
            we slice perpendicular to that axis with slices of thickness <m>\Delta x</m>.
            A representative slice is in the shape of a washer and has volume

            To use the same region <m>S</m> as in part (c),

            For this pair of curves,

            and hence where <m>(y-1)^2 = y+1</m>.
            Expanding, moving all terms to the left,
            and combining like terms,
            we see that <m>y^2 - 2y + 1 = y + 1</m>, so
            <m>y^2 - 3y = 0</m>.
            It follows that <m>y(y-3) = 0</m> and therefore <m>y=3</m> or <m>y = 0</m>.
            Plotting the region and revolving about the <m>y</m>-axis,
            we see that horizontal slices of thickness
            <m>\Delta y</m> are shaped like washers.
            The outer radius is given by <m>R(y) = y+1</m>,

            The volume of the solid of revolution is therefore
