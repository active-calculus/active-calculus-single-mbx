      Suppose it is known that for a given differentiable function <m>y = g(x)</m>,
      its local linearization at the point where <m>a = -1</m> is given by <m>L(x) = -2 + 3(x+1)</m>.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>

            Compute the values of <m>L(-1)</m> and <m>L'(-1)</m>.

        <li>

            What must be the values of <m>g(-1)</m> and <m>g'(-1)</m>?

        <li>

            Do you expect the value of

            Why?

            Using the formula for <m>L</m>,
            <m>L(-1) = -2</m>; Since
      <m>L'(x) = 3</m>, we see <m>L'(-1) = 3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>L(x) = g(-1) + g'(-1)(x+1) = -2 + 3(x+1)</m>,
            we see <m>g(-1) = -2</m> and <m>g'(-1) = 3</m>.
            Alternatively,
            we could observe that the value and slope of <m>g</m> must match the value and slope of <m>L</m> at the point of tangency.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Because <m>g'(-1) = 3</m>,
            we see that <m>g</m> is increasing at <m>a = -1</m>?

        <li>
          <p>
            Observe that <m>g(-1.03) \approx L(-1.03) = -2 + 3(-1.03+1) = -2 - 0.09 = -2.09</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>g''(-1) > 0</m>,
      we know <m>g</m> is concave up at <m>x = -1</m>.

            In the figure below,
            we use the results of our previous work to generate the plot shown,
            which is a possible graph of <m>y = g(x)</m> near <m>x = -1</m>,
            along with the tangent line
