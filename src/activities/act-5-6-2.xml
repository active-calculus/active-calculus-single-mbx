        <li>
          <p>
            Since the velocity is always positive, the definite integral that will give the exact distance traveled by the car on the interval <m>[0, 1.8]</m> is
            <me>
              \int_0^{1.8} v(t) dt.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The estimates of <m>\int_0^{1.8} v(t) dt</m> are
            <md>
              <mrow>L_3 \amp = 165.6 \text{ ft }  \amp  R_3 \amp = 105.6 \text{ ft }  \amp  T_3 \amp = 135.6 \text{ ft }.</mrow>
            </md>
            <m>R_3</m> is an underestimate of the distance traveled since <m>v(t)</m> is decreasing. <m>T_3</m> is an underestimate of the distance traveled since <m>v(t)</m> is concave down.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Another estimate of the distance traveled is
            <me>
              M_3 = 143.4 \text{ ft } .
            </me>
            This is an overestimate since <m>v(t)</m> is concave down.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For Simpson's Rule, we see that
            <me>
              S_6 = \frac{2}{3}M_3 + \frac{1}{3}T_3 = 140.8 \text{ ft } .
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Simpson's rule gives the best approximation of the distance traveled since it is a weighted average of the midpoint and trapezoid rules and uses more information about the velocity than the other methods.  The units on each of the estimates, including Simpson's Rule, are "feet", since ft/sec <m>\cdot</m> sec = ft.  Thus, the best approximation we have generated is that <m>\int_0^{1.8} v(t) dt \approx 140.8 \text{ ft }</m>.
