Express the following statements as
differential equations. In each case, you will need to introduce notation
to describe the important quantities in the statement so be sure to
clearly state what your notation means.
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>The population of a town grows continuously at an annual rate of
                  1.25<percent />.</p></li>
        <li><p>A radioactive sample loses
                  5.6<percent /> of its mass every day.</p></li>
        <li><p>You have a bank account that continuously earns 4<percent /> interest every
                  year.  At the same time, you withdraw money continually from
                  the account at the rate of <dollar />1000 per year.</p></li>
        <li><p>A cup of hot chocolate is sitting in a 70<m>^\circ</m> room.
                  The temperature of the hot chocolate cools continuously by 10<percent /> of
                  the difference between the hot chocolate's temperature and
                  the room temperature every minute.</p></li>
        <li><p>A can of cold soda is sitting in a 70<m>^\circ</m> room.
                  The temperature of the soda warms continuously at the rate of 10<percent /> of
                  the difference between the soda's temperature and
                  the room's temperature every minute.</p></li>
