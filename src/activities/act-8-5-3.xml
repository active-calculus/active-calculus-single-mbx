            The graphs of the 10th (magenta), 20th (blue),

            It appears that as we increase the order of the Taylor polynomials,
            they fit the graph of <m>f</m> better and better over larger intervals.
            So it looks like the Taylor polynomials converge to <m>e^x</m> for every value of <m>x</m>.

            It appears that as we increase the order of the Taylor polynomials,
            they only fit the graph of <m>f</m> better and better over the interval <m>(-1,1)</m> and appear to diverge outside that interval.
            So it looks like the Taylor polynomials converge to
            <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> only on the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>.
