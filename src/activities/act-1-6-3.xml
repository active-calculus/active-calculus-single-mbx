  <statement>
    <p permid="uEA">
      This activity builds on our experience and understanding of how to sketch the graph of <m>f'</m> given the graph of <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="aLJ">
      In <xref ref="F-1-6-A2">Figure</xref>,
      given the respective graphs of two different functions <m>f</m>,
      sketch the corresponding graph of <m>f'</m> on the first axes below,
      and then sketch <m>f''</m> on the second set of axes.
      In addition, for each,
      write several careful sentences in the spirit of those in <xref ref="act-1-6-1">Activity</xref>
      that connect the behaviors of <m>f</m>,
      <m>f'</m>, and <m>f''</m>.
      For instance, write something such as
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="WbQ">
      <p permid="Oxr">
        <m>f'</m> is <fillin /> on the interval <fillin />,
        which is connected to the fact that <m>f</m> is <fillin /> on the same interval <fillin />, and <m>f''</m> is <fillin /> on the interval.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="GSS">
      but of course with the blanks filled in.
      Throughout,
      view the scale of the grid for the graph of <m>f</m> as being <m>1 \times 1</m>,
      and assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of <m>f'</m> is identical to that for <m>f</m>.
      If you need to adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graph of <m>f'</m> or <m>f''</m>,
      you should label that accordingly.
    </p>

  <hint permid="pUH">
    <p permid="iqi">
      Remember that to plot <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      it is helpful to first identify where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
