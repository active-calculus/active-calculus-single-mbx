<statement>
<p>Suppose you have a bank account that grows by 5<percent /> every year. Let <m>A(t)</m> be the amount of money in the account in year <m>t</m>.

      <ol label="a">
        <li><p>What is the rate of change of <m>A</m> with respect to <m>t</m>?</p></li>

        <li><p>Suppose that you are also withdrawing <dollar />10,000 per year.  Write
              a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of
              <m>A</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Sketch a slope field for this differential equation, find any
              equilibrium solutions, and identify them as either stable or
              unstable.  Write a sentence or two that describes the significance
              of the stability of the equilibrium solution.</p></li>

        <li><p>Suppose that you initially deposit <dollar />100,000 into the account.  How
              long does it take for you to deplete the account?</p></li>

        <li><p>What is the smallest amount of money you would need to have in
              the account to guarantee that you never deplete the money in the
              account?</p></li>

        <li><p>If your initial deposit is <dollar />300,000, how much could you
              withdraw every year without depleting the account?</p></li>
