  <solution>
    <p>
      Let <m>A(t)</m> be the amount of money in a bank account in year <m>t</m> that grows by 5<percent /> every year.
      <ol label = "a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            The rate of change of <m>A</m> with respect to <m>t</m> is <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If <dollar />10000 is being withdrawn every year, then
            <me>
              \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A - 10000.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Following is a slope field for the differential equation in (b).
          </p>
              <sidebyside>
                <image source="images/7_5_Act1_slope_field">

              <p>
            Equilibrium solutions occur where <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = 0</m> and so the only equilibriume solution is <m>A = 200000</m>.  This means that if you have <dollar />200000 in the account, then the amount of money in the account will remain constant at <dollar />200000.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose we initially have <dollar />100000 in the account.  We will solve the intitial value problem
            <me>
              \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A - 10000,   A(0) = 100000.
            </me>
            Using separation of variables, we find that
            <me>
              A = 200000 + C e^{t/20},
            </me>
            and since <m>A(0) = 100000</m>, we have
            <me>
              A = 200000 - 100000e^{t/20}.
            </me>
            To determine when the account will be depleted, we solve the equation <m>A = 0</m> for <m>t</m>.  Since <m>200000 - 100000 e^{t/20} = 0</m>, it follows <m>e^{t/20} = 2</m> and thus <m>t = 20 \ln(2)</m>, so the account will be depleted in about 13.86 years.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            You must have at least <dollar />200000 in the account to make sure the account will never be depleted.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now suppose the intitial deposit is <dollar />300000 and we want to what amount <m>w</m> we can withdraw every year without depleting the account.  So the initial value problem is
            <me>
              \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A - w, A(0) = 300000.
            </me>
            The solution to this initial value problem is
            <me>
              A = 20w + (300000 - 20w) e^{t/20}.
            </me>
            To make sure the account is never depleted, we need <m>(300000 - 20W)</m> to be greater than or equal to 0.  Solving the inequality <m>300000 - 2w \geq 0</m>, we obtain <m>w \leq 15000</m>.  We can withdraw up to <dollar />15000 every year and the account will not be depleted.
          </p>

      </ol>
    </p>
