      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Based on the given graph of <m>g''</m>,
            the only point at which <m>g''</m> changes sign is <m>x = -1</m>,
            and hence this is an inflection point of <m>g</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Note that <m>g''(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \lt -1</m>,
            <m>g''(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m>,
            and <m>g''(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x \gt 2</m>.
            This tells us that <m>g</m> is concave up for <m>x \lt -1</m>,
            concave down for <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m>,
            and concave down for <m>x \gt 2</m>.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Given that <m>g'(-1.67857351) = 0</m>,
            we know that <m>g</m> has a horizontal tangent line at this critical number.
            In addition, from the given graph of <m>g''</m>,
            we see that <m>g''( -1.67857351) \gt 0</m> and observe that <m>g</m> is concave up at <m>x</m>-values near <m>-1.67857351</m>.
            By the second derivative test,
            <m>g</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1.67857351</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            From the given graph,
            since <m>g''</m> has a simple zero at <m>x = -1</m> and a repeated zero at <m>x = 2</m>,
            it appears that <m>g''</m> is a degree 3 polynomial.
            If so, then <m>g'</m> is a degree 4 polynomial,
            and <m>g</m> is a degree 5 polynomial.
