      As pictured in the applet at<nbsp /><url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/9q">http://gvsu.edu/s/9q</url>,
      a skateboarder who is 6 feet tall rides under a 15 foot tall lamppost at a constant rate of 3 feet per second.
      We are interested in understanding how fast his shadow is changing at various points in time.

            Draw an appropriate right triangle that represents a snapshot in time of the skateboarder,

            and his shadow.
            Let <m>x</m> denote the horizontal distance from the base of the lamppost to the skateboarder and <m>s</m> represent the length of his shadow.
            Label these quantities,
            as well as the skateboarder's height and the lamppost's height on the diagram.
