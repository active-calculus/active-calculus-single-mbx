            For this Riemann sum with five subintervals,
            <m>\Delta t = \frac{5-1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}</m>,
            so <m>t_0 = 1</m>, <m>t_1 = 1.8</m>, <m>t_2 = 2.6</m>,
            <m>t_3 = 3.4</m>, <m>t_4 = 4.2</m> and <m>t_5 = 4</m>.
            It follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>M_5 =\mathstrut \amp  v(1.4) \Delta t + v(2.2) \Delta t + v(3.0) \Delta t + v(3.8) \Delta t + v(4.6)</mrow>

              <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  -\frac{36}{25} = -1.44</mrow>

            A sketch is shown below.

        <li>
          <p>
            Since the net signed area bounded by <m>v</m> on <m>[1,5]</m> represents the total change in position of the object on the interval <m>[1,5]</m>,
            it follows that <m>M_5</m> estimates the total change in position.
            Hence,
      the change in position is approximately <m>-1.44</m> feet.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            To estimate the total distance traveled by the object on <m>[1,5]</m>,
            we have to calculate the total area between the curve and the <m>t</m>-axis.
            Thus,
            <me>
              D \approx \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 1 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} +  \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{292}{125} \approx 2.336
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Using appropriate technology,
            <m>M_{10} = -1.36</m> and <m>M_{20} = -1.34</m>.
            Further calculations suggest that
            <m>M_n \to -\frac{4}{3} = -1.\overline{33}</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>,
            and this number represents the object's total change in position on <m>[1,5]</m>.
