    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8-5-1">Activity</xref>
      we determined small order Taylor polynomials for a few familiar functions,
      and also found general patterns in the derivatives evaluated at <m>0</m>.
      Use that information to write the Taylor series centered at <m>0</m> for the following functions.

              \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}}{k!} x^k = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{k!}{k!} x^k = \sum_{k=0}^n  x^k

            This makes sense since <m>f(x)</m> is the sum of the geometric series with ratio <m>x</m>,
            so the <m>n</m>th order Taylor polynomial should just be the <m>n</m>th partial sum of this geometric series.
