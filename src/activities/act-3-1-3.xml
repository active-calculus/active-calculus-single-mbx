        <m>h(x) = x^2 + \cos(3x)</m> is given in dark blue, while <m>h(x) = x^2 + \cos(1.6x)</m> is shown in light blue.  Close inspection of the light blue graph reveals some subtle changes in concavity around <m>x \approx \pm 0.5</m>.  For values smaller than <m>1.6</m>, it is very hard to visually detect any inflection points in <m>h(x)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Treating <m>k</m> as an arbitrary constant, we first observe that <m>h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)</m>. Again treating <m>k</m> as a constant and differentiating, we find
        <me>
          h''(x) = 2 - k^2\cos(kx).
        </me>
        We seek the values of <m>x</m> for which <m>h''(x) = 0</m> at which <m>h''</m> changes sign.  Setting <m>h''(x) = 0</m> and rearranging the resulting equation, we now seek <m>x</m> such that
        <me>
          k^2 \cos(kx) = 2,
        </me>
        or
        <me>
          \cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}.
        </me>
        Now, remember that <m>k</m> is an arbitrary positive constant and recall that <m>-1 \le \cos(\theta) \le 1</m> for all input values <m>\theta</m>.  If <m>\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1</m>, then the equation <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has no solution.  Hence, whenever <m>k^2 \lt  2</m>, or <m>k \lt  \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414</m>, it follows that the equation <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has no solutions <m>x</m>, which means that <m>h''(x)</m> is never zero (indeed, for these <m>k</m>-values, <m>h''(x)</m> is always positive so that <m>h</m> is always concave up).

        On the other hand, if <m>k \ge \sqrt{2}</m>, then <m>\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1</m>, which guarantees that <m>\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}</m> has infinitely many solutions, due to the periodicity of the cosine function.
