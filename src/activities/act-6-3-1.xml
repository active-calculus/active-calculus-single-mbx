                  we naturally consider slices of the cone that are perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis.
                  For each such slice,

            To find where to cut the bar in two so that the two pieces have equal mass,

            Thus, <m>(b-15)^3 - (-15)^3 = 75 \cdot \frac{558}{25} = 3 \cdot 558 = 1674</m>,
            so <m>(b-15)^3 = 1675 - 3375 = -1700</m>.
            It follows that <m>b-15 = \sqrt[3]{-1700} \approx -11.9348</m>,
            so <m>b \approx 3.0652</m>.
