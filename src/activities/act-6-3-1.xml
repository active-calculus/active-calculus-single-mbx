      Consider the following situations in which mass is distributed in a non-constant manner.
      <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose that a thin rod with constant cross-sectional area of 1 cm<m>^2</m> has its mass distributed according to the density function <m>\rho(x) = 2e^{-0.2x}</m>,
          where <m>x</m> is the distance in cm from the left end of the rod,
          and the units on <m>\rho(x)</m> are g/cm.
          If the rod is 10 cm long,
      determine the exact mass of the rod.

      <li>
        <p>
          Consider the cone that has a base of radius 4 m and a height of 5 m.
          Picture the cone lying horizontally with the center of its base at the origin and think of the cone as a solid of revolution.
          <ol label="i.">
            <li>
              <p>
                Write and evaluate a definite integral whose value is the volume of the cone.

            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Next,
          suppose that the cone has uniform density of 800 kg/m<m>^3</m>.
                What is the mass of the solid cone?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Now suppose that the cone's density is not uniform,
                but rather that the cone is most dense at its base.
                In particular,
                assume that the density of the cone is uniform across cross sections parallel to its base,
                but that in each such cross section that is a distance <m>x</m> units from the origin,
                the density of the cross section is given by the function <m>\rho(x) = 400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}</m>,
                measured in kg/m<m>^3</m>.
                Determine and evaluate a definite integral whose value is the mass of this cone of non-uniform density.
                Do so by first thinking about the mass of a given slice of the cone <m>x</m> units away from the base;
                remember that in such a slice,
                the density will be <em>essentially constant</em>.

          measured in g/cm.

          Since the mass, <m>M</m>,
          is given by <m>M = \int_a^b \rho(x) \, dx</m>, it follows that
          <me>
            M = \int_{0}^{10} 2e^{-0.2x} = \left. \frac{2}{-0.2}e^{-0.2x} \right|_{0}^{20} = -0.1e^{-4}+0.1e^{0}
          </me>,
          and hence <m>M = 0.1 - 0.1e^{-4} \approx 0.0981684</m> grams.

      <li>
        <p>
          Consider the cone that has a base of radius 4 m and a height of 5 m.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol label="i.">
            <li>
              <p>
                With the cone having its base centered at the origin and being a solid of revolution about the <m>x</m>-axis,
                the cone is generated by the line <m>y = 4 - \frac{4}{5}x</m>.
                Using the disk method,
                it follows that the cone's volume is
                <me>
                  V = \int_{0}^{5} \pi (4 - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 \, dx = \frac{80\pi}{3} \approx 83.7758 \mbox{m}^3
                </me>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                If the cone has uniform density 800 kg/m<m>^3</m>,
                we know that the cone's mass is the product of its density and volume, and thus
                <me>
                  M = \rho \cdot V = 800 \cdot \frac{80\pi}{3} = \frac{6400\pi}{3} \approx 67020.6433 \mbox{kg}
                </me>.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                If the cone has non-uniform density,
                but is uniform across cross sections parallel to its base such that in each cross section a distance <m>x</m> units from the origin has its density given by <m>\rho(x) = 400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}</m> kg/m<m>^3</m>,
                we naturally consider slices of the cone that are perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis.
                For each such slice,
                the radius is <m>r(x) = 4 - \frac{4}{5}x</m>,
                which makes the volume of the slice
                <me>
                  V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi (4-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 \Delta x
                </me>.
                Since the density is constant on the slice with value <m>\rho(x) = 400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}</m>,
                it follows that the mass of the slice is
                <me>
                  M_{\text{slice}} \approx (400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}) \cdot \pi (4-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 \Delta x
                </me>.
                Using a definite integral to let
                <m>\Delta x \to 0</m> and add up the values of all of the slices,
                we thus find the mass of the cone with this density distribution to be

          The total mass of the bar is given by <m>M = \int_{0}^{12} \frac{1}{25}(x-15)^2 \, dx = \frac{1116}{25}</m>.
          To find where to cut the bar in two so that the two pieces have equal mass,
          we have to determine the value of <m>b</m> such that
          <me>
            \int_{0}^{b} \frac{1}{25}(x-15)^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1116}{25}
          </me>.
          Since <m>\int_{0}^{b} \frac{1}{25}(x-15)^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{75}( (b-15)^3 - (-15)^3 )</m>,
          we need to have <m>b</m> satisfy the equation
          <me>
            \frac{1}{75}( (b-15)^3 - (-15)^3 ) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1116}{25}
          </me>.
          Thus, <m>(b-15)^3 - (-15)^3 = 75 \cdot \frac{558}{25} = 3 \cdot 558 = 1674</m>,
          so <m>(b-15)^3 = 1675 - 3375 = -1700</m>.
          It follows that <m>b-15 = \sqrt[3]{-1700} \approx -11.9348</m>,
          so <m>b \approx 3.0652</m>.
