    <p>
      Consider the following situations in which a varying force accomplishes work.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose that a heavy rope hangs over the side of a cliff.
          The rope is 200 feet long and weighs 0.3 pounds per foot;
          initially the rope is fully extended.
          How much work is required to haul in the entire length of the rope? (Hint:
          set up a function <m>F(h)</m> whose value is the weight of the rope remaining over the cliff after <m>h</m> feet have been hauled in.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          A leaky bucket is being hauled up from a 100 foot deep well.
          When lifted from the water,
      the bucket and water together weigh 40 pounds.
          As the bucket is being hauled upward at a constant rate,
          the bucket leaks water at a constant rate so that it is losing weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot.
          What function <m>B(h)</m> tells the weight of the bucket after the bucket has been lifted <m>h</m> feet?
          What is the total amount of work accomplished in lifting the bucket to the top of the well?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Now suppose that the bucket in (b) does not leak at a constant rate,
          but rather that its weight at a height <m>h</m> feet above the water is given by <m>B(h) = 25 + 15e^{-0.05h}</m>.
          What is the total work required to lift the bucket 100 feet?
          What is the average force exerted on the bucket on the interval <m>h = 0</m> to <m>h = 100</m>?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          From physics, <em>Hooke's Law</em>
          <idx><h>Hooke's Law</h></idx>
      for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed
          (or extended)
          to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed
          (or extended)
          from its natural length.
          That is, the force to compress
          (or extend)
          a spring <m>x</m> units from its natural length is
          <m>F(x) = kx</m> for some constant <m>k</m>
          (which is called the <em>spring constant</em>.)
          For springs,
          we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet.
          Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1/3 foot) beyond its natural length.

          When the full rope is extended over the cliff,
          the weight of the hanging rope is 200 pounds.
          Every foot of rope weighs 0.3 pounds;
          in addition,
          the quantity <m>(200-h)</m> measures the number of feet of rope hanging over the cliff when <m>h</m> feet of rope have been pulled in.
          This means that the function <m>F(h)</m> whose value is the weight of the rope hanging over the cliff after <m>h</m> feet have been pulled in is given by <m>F(h) = 0.3(200-h)</m>.
          When a small amount of rope, <m>\Delta h</m>,
          is pulled in, the work to move that slice of rope is given by
          <me>
            W_{\text{slice}} = F(h) \Delta h = 0.3(200-h) \Delta h
          </me>.
          Thus, the total work to pull in the 200 feet of rope is given by
          <me>
            W = \int_0^{200} 0.3(200-h) \, dh = 6000 \text{ foot-pounds}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Since <m>B(h)</m> changes at a constant rate,
          <m>B</m> is a linear function.
          We know that <m>B(0) = 40</m> and that <m>B</m> loses weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot of rope hauled in.
          Thus, <m>B(h) = 40 - 0.1h</m>.
          It follows that the total work to life the leaky bucket 100 feet is
          <me>
            W = int_0^{100} (40-0.1h) \, dh = 3500 \text{foot-pounds}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Given that <m>B(h) = 25 + 15e^{-0.05h}</m> is the weight of the bucket when <m>h</m> feet of rope have been pulled in,
          it follows that the total work to move the bucket 100 feet is
          <me>
            W = \int_0^{100} (25 + 5e^{-0.05h})\, dh \approx 2597.98 \text{ foot-pounds}
          </me>.
          In addition,
          the average force that was exerted on the bucket is precisely the average weight of the bucket, which is
          <me>
            B_{\text{AVG} [0,100]} = \frac{1}{100-0} \int_0^{100} (25 + 5e^{-0.05h})\, dh \approx 25.9798 \text{ pounds}
          </me>.

          Now considering the given spring,
          <ol label="i.">
            <li>
              <p>
                Since <m>F(1/3) = 5</m> and <m>F(x) = kx</m> by Hoooke's Law,
                it follows that <m>5 = k \cdot \frac{1}{3}</m>,
          and thus <m>k = 15</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Because the work to stretch the spring 1 foot is given by <m>W = \int_0^1 F(x) \, dx</m>,
                it follows <m>W = \int_0^1 15x \, dx = \frac{15}{2} \text{ foot-pounds}</m>.
              </p>

            <li>

                Here,
          <m>W = \int_1^{1.5} F(x) \, dx = \int_1^{1.5} 15x \, dx = 9.375 \text{ foot-pounds}</m>.
