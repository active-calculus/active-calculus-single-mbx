            As the bucket is being hauled upward at a constant rate,

            From physics, <em>Hooke's Law</em>
              <idx><h>Hooke's Law</h></idx>
            for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed
            (or extended)
            to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed
            (or extended)
            from its natural length.
            That is, the force to compress
            (or extend)
            a spring <m>x</m> units from its natural length is
            <m>F(x) = kx</m> for some constant <m>k</m>
            (which is called the <em>spring constant</em>.)
            For springs,
            we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet.
            Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1/3 foot) beyond its natural length.

            When the full rope is extended over the cliff,
            the weight of the hanging rope is 200 pounds.
            Every foot of rope weighs 0.3 pounds;
            in addition,
            the quantity <m>(200-h)</m> measures the number of feet of rope hanging over the cliff when <m>h</m> feet of rope have been pulled in.
            This means that the function <m>F(h)</m> whose value is the weight of the rope hanging over the cliff after <m>h</m> feet have been pulled in is given by <m>F(h) = 0.3(200-h)</m>.
            When a small amount of rope, <m>\Delta h</m>,
            is pulled in, the work to move that slice of rope is given by

            Thus, <m>B(h) = 40 - 0.1h</m>.
