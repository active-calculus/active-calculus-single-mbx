  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity <m>v</m>
      (in meters per second)
      at time <m>t</m>
      (in seconds)
      given by the piecewise linear function whose graph is pictured at left in <xref ref="F-4-1-Act3">Figure</xref>.
      We view movement to the right as being in the positive direction
      (with positive velocity),
      while movement to the left is in the negative direction.

      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between
            <m>y = v(t)</m> and the <m>t</m>-axis on <m>[0,1]</m> and <m>[1,2]</m>
            (each of which is <m>1</m>),
            it follows that the object's total distance traveled is <m>2</m>,
            while its change in position is <m>0</m>.
            The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by <m>v</m> on <m>[0,2]</m> is <m>1 - 1 = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The object's position is increasing wherever its velocity is positive,
            hence for <m>0 \le t \lt 1</m> and <m>4 \lt t \lt 8 </m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            By calculating the area bounded by the curve,
            we find 1 unit of area on <m>[0,1]</m>, 4 units of area on <m>[1,4]</m>,
            and 8 units of area on <m>[4,8]</m>,
            thus the total distance traveled on
            <m>0 \le t \le 8</m> is <m>D = 1 + 4 + 8</m> meters.
            As the change in position is given by the net signed area on this interval,
            we find that the change in position is
            <me>
              s(8) - s(0) = 1 - 4 + 8 = 5 \ \mbox{m}
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            In the figure below,
            at left we list all of the areas bounded by <m>v</m> on each one-unit subinterval.
            Along with the given starting point that <m>s(0) = 1</m>,
            we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function <m>s</m>.
            For instance,
            we know <m>s(1) - s(0) = 1</m>, hence <m>s(1) = 2</m>.
            Similarly, <m>s(2) - s(1) = -1</m>, thus <m>s(2) = 1</m>.
            Continuing across the interval,
            we generate the function <m>s</m> that is pictured at right.
            Note that the portion of <m>s</m> from <m>t = 2</m> to <m>t = 3</m> is linear because <m>v</m> is constant there,
            while the other parts of <m>s</m> appear to be quadratic,
            as they correspond to intervals where <m>v</m> is linear.
