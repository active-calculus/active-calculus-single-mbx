            By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between
            <m>y = v(t)</m> and the <m>t</m>-axis on <m>[0,1]</m> and <m>[1,2]</m>
            (each of which is <m>1</m>),
            it follows that the object's total distance traveled is <m>2</m>,
            while its change in position is <m>0</m>.
            The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by <m>v</m> on <m>[0,2]</m> is <m>1 - 1 = 0</m>.

            The object's position is increasing wherever its velocity is positive,

            By calculating the area bounded by the curve,
            we find 1 unit of area on <m>[0,1]</m>, 4 units of area on <m>[1,4]</m>,
            and 8 units of area on <m>[4,8]</m>,
            thus the total distance traveled on
            <m>0 \le t \le 8</m> is <m>D = 1 + 4 + 8</m> meters.
            As the change in position is given by the net signed area on this interval,
            we find that the change in position is

            In the figure below,
            at left we list all of the areas bounded by <m>v</m> on each one-unit subinterval.
            Along with the given starting point that <m>s(0) = 1</m>,
            we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function <m>s</m>.
            For instance,
            we know <m>s(1) - s(0) = 1</m>, hence <m>s(1) = 2</m>.
            Similarly, <m>s(2) - s(1) = -1</m>, thus <m>s(2) = 1</m>.
            Continuing across the interval,
            we generate the function <m>s</m> that is pictured at right.
            Note that the portion of <m>s</m> from <m>t = 2</m> to <m>t = 3</m> is linear because <m>v</m> is constant there,
            while the other parts of <m>s</m> appear to be quadratic,
            as they correspond to intervals where <m>v</m> is linear.
