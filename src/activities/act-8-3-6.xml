      <statement>
        <p>Consider the series <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m>. Since the convergence or divergence of a series only depends on the behavior of the series for large values of <m>k</m>, we might examine the terms of this series more closely as <m>k</m> gets large.

        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>By computing the value of <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> for <m>k = 100</m> and <m>k = 1000</m>, explain why the terms <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> are essentially <m>\frac{k}{k^3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let's formalize our observations in (a) a bit more. Let <m>a_k =  \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> and <m>b_k =  \frac{k}{k^3}</m>. Calculate
              <me>
                \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k}
              </me>.
              What does the value of the limit tell you about <m>a_k</m> and <m>b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>? Compare your response from part (a).</p>
            </li>

          <li>
            <p>Does the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3}</m> converge or diverge? Why? What do you think that tells us about the convergence or divergence of the series <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m>? Explain.</p>

        <p><ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>When <m>k</m> is very large, the constant 1 in the numerator is negligible compared to <m>k</m> and the constant 2 in the denominator is negligible compared to <m>k^3</m>. So the numerator looks like <m>k</m> and the denominator <m>k^3</m> when <m>k</m> is large. It follows that <m>\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> looks like <m>\frac{k}{k^3}</m> when <m>k</m> is large.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Note that
              <md>
                <mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{k+1}{k^3+2} }{ \frac{k}{k^3} }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{(k+1)k^3}{k(k^3+2)}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1+\frac{1}{k}}{1+\frac{2}{k}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = 1</mrow>
              </md>.
              This tells us that <m>a_k \approx b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>, which is what we suggested in part (a).</p>
            </li>

          <li>
            <p>Since <m>\frac{k}{k^3} = \frac{1}{k^2}</m>, the series <m>\sum \frac{k}{k^3}</m> is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p=2</m> and so converges. Since <m>a_k \approx b_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>, it seems reasonable to expect that <m>\sum a_k \approx \sum b_k</m> for large <m>k</m>s. Since <m>\sum a_k</m> is finite, we should then conclude that <m>\sum b_k</m> is also finite. So <m>\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}</m> should be a convergent series.</p>
