      Use the quotient rule to answer each of the questions below.
      Throughout,
      be sure to carefully label any derivative you find by name.
      That is, if you're given a formula for <m>f(x)</m>,
      clearly label the formula you find for <m>f'(x)</m>.
      It is not necessary to algebraically simplify any of the derivatives you compute.

            where <m>I</m> is measured in candles and <m>t</m> is measured in milliseconds.
            Compute <m>I'(0.5)</m>, <m>I'(2)</m>,
            and <m>I'(5)</m>; include appropriate units on each value;

      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            By the quotient rule,
            <me>
              r'(z)=\frac{(z^4+1) 3^z \ln(3) - 3^z(4z^3)}{(z^4 + 1)^2}

        <li>
          <p>
            By the quotient rule,
            <me>
              v'(t) = \frac{(\cos(t) + t^2)\cos(t) - \sin(t)(\sin(t) + 2t)}{(\cos(t) + t^2)^2}
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We first compute <m>R'(x)</m>.
            By the quotient rule,
            <me>
              R'(x) = \frac{(x^2 - 9)(2x - 2) - (x^2 - 2x - 8)(2x)}{(x^2 - 9)^2}
            </me>.
            From this,
            it follows that <m>R'(0) = \frac{(-9)(-2)-(-8)(0)}{(-9)^2} = -\frac{2}{9}</m>,
            which is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point where <m>x = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            By the quotient rule and algebraic simplification,
            <me>
              I'(t) = \frac{e^t 100 - 100te^t}{(e^t)^2} = \frac{100-100t}{e^t}
            </me>.
            Thus,
            <m>I'(0.5) = \frac{50}{e^{0.5}} \approx 30.327</m>,
            <m>I'(2) = \frac{-100}{e^{2}} \approx -13.534</m>,
            and <m>I'(5) = \frac{-400}{e^4} \approx -2.695</m>,
            each measured in candles per millisecond.
            These results show that at <m>t = 0.5</m>,
            the intensity of the flash is increasing rapidly,
            while at <m>t = 2</m> and <m>t = 5</m>,
            the intensity is decreasing,
            with the intensity decreasing more rapidly when <m>t = 2</m>.
