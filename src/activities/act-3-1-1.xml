        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}</m>,
            we see that <m>g'(x) = 0</m> implies that <m>x = -4</m> or <m>x = 1</m>.
            While <m>x = 2</m> makes <m>g'</m> undefined,
            we are told that <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m>,
            so <m>x = 2</m> is not in the domain of <m>g</m>,
            and hence is technically not a critical number of <m>g</m>.
            Nonetheless,
            we place <m>x = 2</m> on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which <m>g'</m> may change sign.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The first derivative sign chart shows that <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \lt -4</m>,
            <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>-4 \lt x \lt 1</m>,
            <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>1 \lt x \lt 2</m>,
            and <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \gt 2</m>.
            By the first derivative test,
            <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m> and neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>.
            As these are the only two critical numbers,
            these are the only two locations for possible extremes. (Note:
            although <m>g</m> changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x = 2</m>,
            this is due to a vertical asymptote,
            and <m>g</m> does not have a minimum there.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Because <m>g</m> is decreasing as <m>x \to 2^-</m>
            (where <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote),
            <m>g</m> does not have a global minimum.
            For <m>x \gt 2</m>, <m>g</m> is always increasing,
            which suggests that <m>g</m> does not have a global maximum (though we do not know for sure that <m>g</m> increases without bound).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We observe that
            <md>
              <mrow>\lim_{x \to \infty} g'(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}</mrow>
              <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 4}{x-2} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}}</mrow>
              <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2 + 2x - 7 + \frac{4}{x}}{1 - \frac{2}{x}}</mrow>
              <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \infty</mrow>
            </md>
            Since <m>g'(x) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
            this tells us that <m>g</m> increases without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            From all of our work above,
            we know that <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m>,
            a horizontal tangent line with neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>,
            and a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m>,
            plus <m>g</m> and <m>g'</m> both increase without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
            Thus,
      a possible graph of <m>g</m> is the following.
