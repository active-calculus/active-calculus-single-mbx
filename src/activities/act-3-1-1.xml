            Since <m>g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}</m>,
            we see that <m>g'(x) = 0</m> implies that <m>x = -4</m> or <m>x = 1</m>.
            While <m>x = 2</m> makes <m>g'</m> undefined,
            we are told that <m>g</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m>,
            so <m>x = 2</m> is not in the domain of <m>g</m>,
            and hence is technically not a critical number of <m>g</m>.
            Nonetheless,
            we place <m>x = 2</m> on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which <m>g'</m> may change sign.

            The first derivative sign chart shows that <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \lt -4</m>,

            <m>g'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>1 \lt x \lt 2</m>,
            and <m>g'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x \gt 2</m>.
            By the first derivative test,
            <m>g</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = -4</m> and neither a max nor min at <m>x = 1</m>.
            As these are the only two critical numbers,
            these are the only two locations for possible extremes.
            (Note:
            although <m>g</m> changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x = 2</m>,
            this is due to a vertical asymptote,
            and <m>g</m> does not have a minimum there.)

            <m>g</m> does not have a global minimum.
            For <m>x \gt 2</m>, <m>g</m> is always increasing,
