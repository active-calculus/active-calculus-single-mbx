            We note that this average velocity is negative,

            it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <m>t = 1.5</m> is approximately <m>-16</m> ft/sec.
            Similar computations show that at <m>t = 2</m>,
            it appears the instantaneous velocity is about <m>-32</m> ft/sec.
            Note that <m>-16>-32</m>,

            Note that <m>(1,s(1))</m> is the vertex of the parabola given by <m>s(t)</m>.
            At this point, the ball is neither rising nor falling.
            On intervals of the form <m>[a,1]</m>,
            where <m>a \lt 1</m>, the average velocity of the ball is positive;
            on intervals of form <m>[1,b]</m>,
            where <m>b > 1</m>, the average velocity is positive.
            Hence we expect the instantaneous velocity of the ball at the moment <m>t = 1</m> to be zero.
