            The position function

            <m>3\lt t\lt 5</m>,
      <m>7\lt t\lt 9</m>, and <m>10\lt t\lt 12</m>,
            because at every point in such intervals, <m>s'(t)</m> is positive.
            For the provided function,
            <m>s(t)</m> is never decreasing because its derivative is never negative.

        <li>

            The velocity function
      <m>y = v(t)</m> appears to be increasing on the intervals <m>0\lt t\lt 1</m>,

            and <m>10\lt t\lt 11</m> because the curve
            <m>y = s(t)</m> is concave up which corresponds to an increasing first derivative <m>y =s'(t)</m>.
            Similarly,
      <m>y = v(t)</m> appears to be decreasing on the intervals <m>1\lt t\lt 2</m>,
            <m>4\lt t\lt 5</m>, <m>8\lt t\lt 9</m>,
            and <m>11\lt t\lt 12</m> because the curve
            <m>y = s(t)</m> is concave down which corresponds to a decreasing first derivative <m>y =s'(t)</m>.
            On the intervals <m>2\lt t\lt 3</m>, <m>5\lt t\lt 7</m>,
            and <m>9\lt t\lt 10</m>,
      the curve <m>y = s(t)</m> is constant,
            and thus linear, so neither concave up nor concave down.

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>a(t)</m> is the instantaneous rate of change of <m>v(t)</m>,
            <m>a(t) = v'(t)</m>.
            And because <m>v(t) = s'(t)</m>,
            it follows that <m>a(t) = v'(t) = [s'(t)]' = s''(t)</m>,
