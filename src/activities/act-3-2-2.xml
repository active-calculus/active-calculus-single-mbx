              h'(x) = -ae^{-bx}(-b) = abe^{-bx}

            Since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive constants and <m>e^{-bx} \gt 0</m> for all <m>x</m>,
            we see that <m>h'(x)</m> is never zero
            (nor undefined),
            and indeed <m>h'(x) \gt 0</m> for all <m>x</m>.
            Hence <m>h</m> is an always increasing function.

            we have that <m>h''(x) = abe^{-bx}(-b) = -ab^2e^{-bx}</m>.
            As with <m>h'</m>, we recognize that <m>a</m>, <m>b^2</m>,
            and <m>e^{-bx}</m> are always positive,

            As <m>x \to \infty</m>, <m>e^{-bx} \to 0</m>.

            This shows that <m>h</m> has a horizontal asymptote at <m>y = a</m> as we move rightward on its graph.

            As <m>x \to -\infty</m>,

            Noting that <m>h'(x) = abe^{-bx}</m>,
            we see that if we consider different values of <m>b</m>,
            the slope of the graph changes.
            If <m>b</m> is large and <m>x</m> is close to zero,
            <m>h'(x) \approx ab</m>
            (since <m>e^0 = 1</m>),
            so <m>h'(x)</m> is relatively large near <m>x = 0</m>.
            At the same time, for large <m>b</m>,
            <m>e^{-bx}</m> approaches zero quickly as <m>x</m> increases,
            so the curve's slope will quickly approach zero as <m>x</m> increases.
            If <m>b</m> is small,
            the graph is less steep near <m>x = 0</m> and its slope goes to zero less quickly as <m>x</m> increases.

            we see that a typical member of this family looks like the following graph.
