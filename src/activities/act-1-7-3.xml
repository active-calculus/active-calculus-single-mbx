<p>
In this activity, we explore two different functions and classify the points at which each is not differentiable. Let <m>g</m> be the function given by the rule <m>g(x) = |x|</m>, and let <m>f</m> be the function that we have previously explored in <xref ref="PA-1-7">Preview Activity</xref>, whose graph is given again in <xref ref="F-1-7-Act3">Figure</xref>.
  <ol label="a">
    <li><p>Reasoning visually, explain why <m>g</m> is differentiable at every point <m>x</m> such that <m>x \ne 0</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that <m>g'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}.</m></p></li>
    <li><p>Explain why <m>g'(0)</m> fails to exist by using small positive and negative values of <m>h</m>.

    <li><p>State all values of <m>a</m> for which <m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>x = a</m>.  For each, provide a reason for your conclusion.</p></li>
    <li><p>True or false: if a function <m>p</m> is differentiable at <m>x = b</m>, then <m>\lim_{x \to b} p(x)</m> must exist.  Why?</p></li>

<solution>

  <ol label="a">
    <li><p>We know that <m>g(x) = |x|</m> is given by the formula <m>g(x) = -x</m> when <m>x \lt  0</m> and by <m>g(x) = x</m> when <m>x \ge 0</m>.  Each of these pieces of <m>g</m> is a straight line, so at every point other than the point where they meet, the function <m>g</m> has a well-defined slope, and thus is differentiable.</p></li>
    <li><p>Observe that
    <md>
      <mrow>  g'(0) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(0+h)-g(0)}{h}</mrow>
      <mrow>  =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|0+h|-|0|}{h}</mrow>
      <mrow>  =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}</mrow>
    </md></p></li>
    <li><p>Following up on our work in (b), note that whenever <m>h > 0</m>, <m>|h| = h</m>, and thus
    <me>
      \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{h}{h} = 1,
    </me>
    while whenever <m>h \lt  0</m>, <m>|h| = -h</m>, and thus
    <me>
      \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-h}{h} = -1
    </me>
    Since the right- and left-hand limits are not equal, it follows that
    <me>
      g'(0) =  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}
    </me>
    does not exist.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>a = -2, -1, 2, 3</m> because at each of these points <m>f</m> is not continuous.  In addition, <m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>a = -3</m> and <m>a = 1</m> because the graph of <m>f</m> has a corner point (or cusp) at each of these values.</p></li>
    <li><p>True: if a function <m>p</m> is differentiable at <m>x = b</m>, then <m>\lim_{x \to b} p(x)</m> must exist.  This is true because we know that if <m>p</m> is differentiable at a point, then <m>p</m> is continuous there, and anytime a function is continuous at a point, it must have a limit there.</p></li>
