    <p>
      In this activity,
      we explore two different functions and classify the points at which each is not differentiable.
      Let <m>g</m> be the function given by the rule <m>g(x) = |x|</m>,
      and let <m>f</m> be the function that we have previously explored in <xref ref="PA-1-7">Preview Activity</xref>,
      whose graph is given again in <xref ref="F-1-7-Act3">Figure</xref>.

            We know that <m>g(x) = |x|</m> is given by the formula
            <m>g(x) = -x</m> when <m>x \lt 0</m> and by <m>g(x) = x</m> when <m>x \ge 0</m>.
            Each of these pieces of <m>g</m> is a straight line,
            so at every point other than the point where they meet,
            the function <m>g</m> has a well-defined slope,
            and thus is differentiable.

        <li>
          <p>
            Following up on our work in (b),
            note that whenever <m>h > 0</m>, <m>|h| = h</m>, and thus
            <me>
              \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{h}{h} = 1
            </me>,
            while whenever <m>h \lt  0</m>, <m>|h| = -h</m>, and thus
            <me>
              \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-h}{h} = -1
            </me>
            Since the right- and left-hand limits are not equal,
            it follows that
            <me>
              g'(0) =  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}
            </me>
            does not exist.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f</m> is not differentiable at
            <m>a = -2, -1, 2, 3</m> because at each of these points <m>f</m> is not continuous.
            In addition,
            <m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>a = -3</m> and <m>a = 1</m> because the graph of <m>f</m> has a corner point
            (or cusp)
            at each of these values.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            True:
      if a function <m>p</m> is differentiable at <m>x = b</m>,
            then <m>\lim_{x \to b} p(x)</m> must exist.
            This is true because we know that if <m>p</m> is differentiable at a point,
            then <m>p</m> is continuous there,
            and anytime a function is continuous at a point,
            it must have a limit there.
