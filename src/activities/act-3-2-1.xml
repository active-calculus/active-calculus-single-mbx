            We first note that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m>,
            so to find critical numbers we set
            <m>p'(x) = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
            This leads to the equation <m>3x^2 - a = 0</m>,
            which implies
            <me permid="EuY">
              x^2 = \frac{a}{3}
            </me>.
            If <m>a \gt 0</m>,
            then the solutions to this equation are <m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>;
            if <m>a \lt  0</m>, then the equation has no solution.
            Hence,
            <m>p</m> has two critical numbers (<m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>) whenever <m>a \gt 0</m> and no critical numbers when <m>a \lt  0</m>.

        <li permid="NeQ">
          <p permid="nwN">
            For the case when <m>a \lt 0</m>,
            we observe that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> is positive for every value of <m>x</m>,
            and thus <m>p</m> is always increasing and has no relative extreme values.
            (There are no critical numbers to place on the first derivative sign chart,
            and <m>p'</m> is always positive.)
            For the case when <m>a\gt 0</m>,
            we observe that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> is a concave up parabola with zeros at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.
            It follows that for <m>x \lt -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m>
            (so <m>p</m> is increasing);
            for <m>-\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}} \lt x \lt \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m> (so <m>p</m> is decreasing);
            and for <m>x\gt \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m>
            (so <m>p</m> is again increasing).
            In this situation, we see that <m>p</m> has a relative maximum at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and a relative minimum at <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.

          <p permid="TDW">
            Since <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> and <m>a</m> is constant,
            it follows that <m>p''(x) = 6x</m>.
            Note that <m>p''(x) = 0</m> when <m>x = 0</m> and that
            <m>p''(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x \lt 0</m> and <m>p''(x)\gt 0</m> for <m>x\gt 0</m>.
            Hence <m>p</m> is CCD for <m>x \lt 0</m> and <m>p</m> is CCU for <m>x\gt 0</m>,
