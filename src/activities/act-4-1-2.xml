            <m>v(t) \gt 0</m>.
            This means that on the interval <m>(0,1)</m>,
            the position function <m>s</m> is increasing because velocity is positive.

            which is the change in position of the ball on the interval <m>[\frac{1}{2},1]</m>.
            Equivalently,
            since <m>v</m> is positive through this interval, 4 feet is the vertical distance the ball traveled during this time.

            On the interval from <m>t = \frac{1}{2}</m> to <m>t = 1</m>,
            the corresponding area under the velocity curve is the area of the right triangular region whose width is
            <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> seconds and whose height is <m>v(\frac{1}{2}) = 16</m> feet/sec.
            That area is therefore <m>A = \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 = 4</m> feet.
            This is the total distance the ball traveled vertically on <m>[0,\frac{1}{2}]</m>.

            <m>s(1) - s(0) = (32 - 16) - (0-0) = 16</m>,
            which is the vertical distance the ball traveled on the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
            The area under the velocity curve on <m>[0,1]</m> is the area of the triangle with height 32 (ft/sec) and base 1 (second),
            which is <m>A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 32 = 16</m> feet.
            These two results are identical,
            in part due to the fact that we are using two different perspectives to compute the same quantity,
            which is distance traveled.

            Observe that <m>s(2) - s(0) = (32 - 32) - (0 - 0) = 0</m>.
            This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.
            But we already established that on the interval <m>[0,1]</m>,
            the ball traveled 16 feet vertically;
            since the velocity becomes negative on the interval <m>1 \lt t \lt 2</m>,
            there we know the ball's position is decreasing,
            so it is falling back to earth.
            The resulting zero change in position means that at <m>t = 2</m> the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed.
            If we view the area between the velocity function and the <m>t</m>-axis as being negative wherever <m>v</m> is negative,
            then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites,
            which in some sense results in the
            <q>total area</q> being zero,
            matching the change in position.
