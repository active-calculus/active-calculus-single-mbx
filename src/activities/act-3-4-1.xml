      A soup can in the shape of a right circular cylinder is to be made from two materials.
      The material for the side of the can costs <dollar />0.015 per square inch and the material for the lids costs <dollar /><m>0.027</m> per square inch.
      Suppose that we desire to construct a can that has a volume of 16 cubic inches.
      What dimensions minimize the cost of the can?

            Volume is the area of the base times the height,
            so <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>.
            Surface area is the area of the lids plus the area of the side,
            the latter of which is a rectangle with height <m>h</m> and width the perimeter of the base.
            Hence, <m>S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h</m>.
            Finally,
            the total cost is the cost of the lids plus the cost of the sides, which is
            <me permid="TEj">
              C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r h \cdot 0.015

        <li permid="oCt">
          <p permid="iNh">
            Because the volume is fixed at 16 cubic inches,
            we know that <m>16 =  \pi r^2 h</m>.
            Solving for <m>h</m>, <m>h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}</m>.
            Substituting this expression for <m>h</m> in the formula for total cost,
            we now have that
            <me permid="zLs">
              C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r \left( \frac{16}{\pi r^2} \right) \cdot 0.015 = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r}
            </me>.
            With <m>C(r) = 0.054 \pi r^2 + 0.48 \frac{1}{r}</m>,
            we note that the only constraint on <m>r</m> is that <m>r \gt 0</m>,
            hence this is the domain on which we seek to minimize <m>C</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li permid="UJC">
          <p permid="OUq">
            Noting that <m>C'(r) = 0.108 \pi r - 0.48 \frac{1}{r^2}</m>,
            we set <m>C'(r) = 0</m> and solve for <m>r</m> to find that
            <me permid="fSB">
              0.108 \pi r = \frac{0.48}{r^2}
            </me>,
            so that <m>r^3 = \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} \approx 1.41471</m>,
            from which it follows that
            <m>r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259</m> is the only critical number of <m>C</m>.
            At this point,
            we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that <m>C</m> has an absolute minimum at <m>r = 1.12259</m>.
            We choose to use the second derivative test;
            note that <m>C''(r) = 0.108 \pi + 0.96 \frac{1}{r^3}</m>,
            which is always positive for <m>r \gt 0</m>,
            hence <m>C</m> is always concave up on the relevant domain (<m>r \gt 0</m>),
            which makes <m>r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.12259</m> where the absolute minimum of <m>C</m> occurs.
            In addition, we note that since <m>h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}</m>,
            the corresponding <m>h</m> value is <m>h \approx 4.041337</m>,
            and the overall minimum cost is <m>C(1.12259) \approx 0.64137</m>.
