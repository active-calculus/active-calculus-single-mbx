            At sea level, air pressure is 30 inches of mercury.
            At an altitude of <m>h</m> feet above sea level,
      the air pressure,

            Let <m>f(x) = \sqrt{e^x + 3}</m>.
            By the chain rule <m>f'(x) = \frac{e^x}{2\sqrt{e^x + 3}}</m>,
            and thus <m>f'(0) = \frac{1}{4}</m>.
            Note further that <m>f(0) = \sqrt{1 + 3} = 2</m>.
            The tangent line is therefore the line through <m>(0,2)</m> with slope <m>1/4</m>, which is
            <me>
              y - 2 = \frac{1}{4}(x-0)
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Observe that <m>s(t) = (t^2 + 1)^{-3}</m>,
            and thus by the chain rule,
      <m>s'(t) = -3(t^2 + 1)^{-4}(2t)</m>.
            We therefore see that <m>s'(1) = -\frac{6}{16} = -\frac{3}{8}</m> inches per second,
            so the particle is moving left at the instant <m>t = 1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            First,
      <m>P'(h) = \frac{dP}{dh} = 30 e^{-0.0000323h} (-0.0000323)</m>.
            Therefore, <m>P'(1000) = 30 e^{-0.0323} (-0.0000323) \approx -0.000938</m> inches of mercury per foot.
            This tells us that the barometric pressure is dropping very slightly for each additional foot of elevation gain.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>C(x) = f(g(x))</m>,
            it follows <m>C'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)</m>.
            Therefore, <m>C'(2) = f'(g(2))g'(2)</m>.
            From the given table, <m>g(2) = -1</m>,
            so applying this result and using additional given information,
            <me>
              C'(2) = f'(-1) g'(2) = (-5)(2) = -10
            </me>.
            For <m>D(x) = f(f(x))</m>,
            the chain rule tells us that <m>D'(x) = f'(f(x))f'(x)</m>,
            so <m>D'(-1) = f'(f(-1))f'(-1)</m>.
            Using the given table, it follows
            <me>
              D'(-1) = f'(2)f'(-1) = (4)(-5) = -20
            </me>.
