            By the Second FTC, <m>A'(x) = f(x)</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>A(1)= \int_2^1 f(t) \, dt = -\int_1^2 f(t) \, dt</m>,
            it follows <m>A(1) = -\frac{\pi}{4}</m>.

            Note that <m>A</m> is increasing wherever <m>f</m> is positive,
            and <m>A</m> is CCU wherever <m>f</m> is increasing.
            Similar conclusions follow for <m>A</m> being decreasing and/or concave down.
            Moreover, <m>A(2) = 0</m>,
            <m>A(3) = -0.5</m>, <m>A(4) = -1.5</m>, <m>A(5) = -2</m>,

        <li>
          <p>
            In our current example,
            <m>A</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m> that satisfies <m>A(0) = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4}</m>.
            Our earlier work with <m>F</m> showed that <m>F</m> is an antiderivative of <m>F</m> that satisfied <m>F(0) = -1</m>.
            Since <m>F</m> and <m>A</m> are both antiderivatives of <m>f</m>,
            they differ by a constant,
            and that constant is <m>-1 - (-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The Second FTC tells us that <m>B' = f</m> and <m>C' = f</m>.
            Thus,
      <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are each antiderivatives of <m>f</m>,
            have the same shape as <m>A</m> and <m>F</m>,
            and each differ from <m>A</m> by just a constant.
            Observing that <m>B(3) = 0</m> and
            <m>C(1) = 0</m> enables us to easily sketch these shifted versions of <m>A</m>.
