  <statement>

      Suppose that a cup of coffee is initially at a temperature of
      <m>105^\circ</m> F and is placed in a <m>75^\circ</m> F room.
      Newton's law of
      cooling says that
      <me>
        \frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-75)

  <solution>
    <p>
      We have
      <me>
        \frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - 75),
      </me>
      where <m>k</m> is a constant. We also have <m>T(0) = 105</m>.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Since the coffee is cooling at a rate of one degree per minute at time <m>0</m>, it follows that <m>\frac{dT}{dt} = -1</m> at this instant.  From the given differential equation, we know <m>-k(T(0) - 75) = -1</m>.  Next, <m>T(0) = 105</m>, so <m>-k(105 - 75) = -1</m>, and thus <m>k = \frac{1}{30}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We use separation of variables to solve the differential equation <m>\frac{dT}{dt} = -\frac{1}{30} (T - 75)</m>.  Separating variables and integrating both sides with respect to <m>t</m>,
            <me>
              \int \frac{1}{T - 75} dT = -\int \frac{1}{30} dt
            </me>
            Integrating both sides, 
            <me>
              \ln \left| T - 75 \right| = -\frac{1}{30} t + c
            </me>
            Using the definition of the logarithm function and writing <m>e^c = C</m>, we see that
            <me>
              |T - 75| = e^{-t/30 + c} = C e^{-t/30}
            </me>
            Finally, including the absolute value in <m>C</m> and solving for <m>T</m>, <m>T - 75 = C e^{-t/30}</m>, so <m>T = 75 + Ce^{-t/30}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            As <m>t \to \infty</m>, <m>e^{-t/30} \to 0</m>.  So 
            <me>
              \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(75 + Ce^{-t/30} \right) = 75.
            </me>  This means that as <m>t \to \infty</m>, <m>T \to 75</m>, or the temperature of the coffee tends to 75 degrees.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            In order to determine the temperature of the coffee after 20 minutes, we need to first determine the value of the constant <m>C</m> in the solution <m>T = 75 + Ce^{-t/30}</m>.  To do this, we use the fact that the temperature of the coffee at <m>t = 0</m> is <m>105^\circ</m>F.  Thus, <m>105 = 75 + Ce^0</m>, so <m>C = 30</m>.
            Now we know that <m>T = 75 + 30e^{-t/30}</m>, and when <m>t = 20</m>, <m>T(20) = 75 + 30e^{-2/3}</m>.  The temperature of the coffee after 20 minutes is approximately <m>90.4^\circ</m>F.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            To determine how long it will take the coffee to cool to <m>80^\circ</m>F, we solve the equation
            <m>80 = 75 + 30 e^{-t/30}</m> for <m>t</m>.  Solving first for <m>e^{-t/30}</m>, we subtract <m>75</m> from both sides and divide by <m>30</m> to get <m>e^{-t/30} = \frac{5}{30}</m>.  Taking logarithms and solving for <m>t</m>, <m>-\frac{t}{30} = \ln \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)</m>, and thus <m>t = -30 \ln \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)</m>.  We conclude that it will take about 53.75 minutes for the coffee to cool to <m>80^\circ</m>F.
