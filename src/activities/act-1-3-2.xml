      A water balloon is tossed vertically in the air from a window.
      The balloon's height in feet at time <m>t</m> in seconds after being launched is given by <m>s(t) = -16t^2 + 16t + 32</m>.
      Use this function to respond to each of the following questions.

      <ol label="a.">
        <li>Since <m>s(t) = -16t^2 + 16t + 32 = -16(t^2 - t - 2) = -16(t-2)(t+1)</m>,
          <m>s</m> has <m>t</m>-intercepts at <m>(2,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m>;
          the <m>s</m>-intercept is clearly <m>(0,32)</m>;
          and the vertex is <m>(\frac{1}{2},36)</m>.
          See more in <xref ref="part-1-3-Act2-soln-d">part</xref>.</li>

        <li>Observe that <m>\frac{s(2)-s(1)}{2-1} = \frac{0 - 32}{1} = -32</m> feet per second.
          This value represents the average rate at which the ball is falling over the time interval from <m>t = 1</m> to <m>t = 2</m>.</li>

        <li>We compute <m>s'(1)</m> as follows:
          <md>
            <mrow>s'(1) = \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(1+h)-s(1)}{h}</mrow>

            <mrow>= \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{-16 - 32h - 16h^2 + 16 + 16h + 32 - 32}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{-16h - 16h^2}{h}</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} (-16-16h)</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp  -16</mrow>
          </md>.

        <p>
          We plot and label the secant line through <m>(1,s(1))</m> and <m>(2,s(2))</m>,
          as well as the tangent line through
          <m>(1,s(1))</m> with slope <m>s'(1)</m>.

        <li>Observe that whenever the ball is rising,
          its position function is rising,
          and thus the slope of its tangent line at any such point will be positive.
          This means that we should find <m>s'(a)</m> to be positive whenever <m>0 \le a \lt  \frac{1}{2}</m>,
          and similarly <m>s'(a)</m> to be negative whenever
          <m>\frac{1}{2} \lt  a \lt  2</m> (which is when the ball is falling).
          At the instant <m>a = \frac{1}{2}</m>,
          the ball is at its vertex and is neither rising nor falling,
          and at that point, <m>s'(\frac{1}{2}) = 0</m>.</li>
