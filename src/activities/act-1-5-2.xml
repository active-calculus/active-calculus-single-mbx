            If <m>C(2000) = 800</m> and <m>C'(2000) = 0.35</m>,
            then we know once 2000 feet of rope are produced,
            the total cost function is increasing at <dollar />0.35 per additional foot of rope.
            Then, if we manufacture an additional 100 feet of rope,
            the additional total cost will be approximately
            <me permid="FGi">
              100 \ \text{feet}  \cdot 0.35 \ \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{foot} } = 35 \ \text{dollars}
            </me>.
            Therefore,
            we find that <m>C(2100) \approx C(2000) + 35 = 835</m>,
            or that the cost to make 2100 feet of rope is about <dollar />835.

            Either <m>C'(2000) = C'(3000)</m> or <m>C'(2000) > C'(3000)</m>,
            since we expect the cost per foot of additional rope to either stay constant or to get smaller as the production volume increases.
            Said differently,
            the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost function should either be constant or decrease due to economy of scale.
          </p>

        <li permid="iiR">
          <p permid="AWp">
            It is impossible to have
            <m>C'(5000) = -0.1</m> and indeed to have any negative derivative value for the total cost function.
            The total cost function <m>C(r)</m> can never decrease,
            because it doesn't make sense for the total cost of producing 5001 feet of rope to be less than the total cost of producing 5000 feet of rope.
