    <p>
      A piece of cardboard that is <m>10 \times 15</m>
      (each measured in inches)
      is being made into a box without a top.
      To do so,
      squares are cut from each corner of the box and the remaining sides are folded up.
      If the box needs to be at least 1 inch deep and no more than 3 inches deep,
      what is the maximum possible volume of the box? what is the minimum volume?
      Justify your answers using calculus.

    <p>
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            We let <m>x</m> represent the length of a side of the square that is cut from each corner,
            so that we have the following picture:
          </p>

          <sidebyside width="50%">
            <image source="images/3_3_Act3Soln" />
          </sidebyside>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Because the box has dimensions <m>(10-2x) \times (15-2x) \times x</m>,
            the volume of the box is given by
            <me>
              V(x) = x (10-2x) (15-2x) = 4x^3 - 50x^2 + 150x
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Clearly the smallest <m>x</m> can be is 0 and the largest <m>x</m> can be is 5, since one side of the cardboard has length 10.
            But we're told in the problem to restrict the value of <m>x</m> to <m>1 \le x \le 3</m>,
            so this is the domain we use for <m>V</m>,
            even though <m>V</m> is defined for every real number <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>V'(x) = 12x^2 - 100x + 150</m>,
            it follows that the critical numbers (where <m>V'(x) = 0</m>) are
            <me>
              x = \frac{25 \pm 5\sqrt{7}}{6} \approx 6.371459426, 1.961873908
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Only the latter critical number is in the relevant domain of <m>V</m>,
            and hence we consider

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>V(1.961873908) = 132.0382370</m>
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>V(1) = 104</m>
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>V(3) = 108</m>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Hence the absolute maximum possible volume of the box is 132.0382370 and occurs when <m>x = 1.961873908</m>,
            while the absolute minimum is 104, which occurs when <m>x=1</m>.
          </p>

      </ol>
