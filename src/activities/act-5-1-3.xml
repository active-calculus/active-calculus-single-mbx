            <m>A</m> is accumulating positive signed area wherever <m>g</m> is positive,
            and thus <m>A</m> is increasing on <m>(0,1.5)</m>,
      <m>(4,6)</m>;
            <m>A</m> is accumulating negative signed area and therefore decreasing wherever <m>g</m> is negative,
            which occurs on <m>(1.5,4)</m>.

        </li>

            Here we want to consider where <m>A</m> is changing at an increasing rate
            (concave up)
            or changing at a decreasing rate (concave down).
            On <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(4,5)</m>, <m>A</m> is increasing,
            and we can also see that since <m>g</m> is increasing,
            <m>A</m> is increasing at an increasing rate.
            Similarly, on <m>(3,4)</m>
            (where <m>g</m> is negative so <m>A</m> is decreasing),
            since <m>g</m> is increasing it follows that <m>A</m> is decreasing at an increasing rate.
            Thus,
      <m>A</m> is concave up on <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(3,5)</m>.
            Analogous reasoning shows that <m>A</m> is concave down on <m>(1,3)</m> and <m>(5,6)</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Based on our work in (a),
            we see that <m>A</m> changes from increasing to decreasing at <m>x = 1.5</m>,
            and thus <m>A</m> has a relative maximum there.
            Similarly, <m>A</m> has a relative minimum at <m>x = 4</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Using the fact that <m>g</m> is piecewise linear and the definition of <m>A</m>,
            we find that <m>A(0) = \int_1^0 g(t) \, dt = -\int_0^1 g(t) \, dt = -\frac{1}{2}</m>;
            <m>A(1) = \int_1^1 g(t) \, dt = 0</m>;
            <m>A(2) = \int_1^2 g(t) \, dt = 0</m>.
            Analogous reasoning shows that <m>A(3) = -2</m>,
            <m>A(4) = -3.5</m>, <m>A(5) = -2</m>, <m>A(6) = -0.5</m>.

            Note that <m>B(0) = 0</m>,
      while <m>A(0) = -\frac{1}{2}</m>.
            Likewise, <m>B(1) = \frac{1}{2}</m>, while <m>A(1) = 0</m>.
            Indeed, we can see that for any value of <m>x</m>,
            <m>B(x) = A(x) + \frac{1}{2}</m>.
