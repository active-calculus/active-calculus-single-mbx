            <m>A</m> is accumulating positive signed area wherever <m>g</m> is positive,

            Here we want to consider where <m>A</m> is changing at an increasing rate
            (concave up)
            or changing at a decreasing rate
            (concave down).
            On <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(4,5)</m>, <m>A</m> is increasing,
            and we can also see that since <m>g</m> is increasing,
            <m>A</m> is increasing at an increasing rate.
            Similarly, on <m>(3,4)</m>
            (where <m>g</m> is negative so <m>A</m> is decreasing),
            since <m>g</m> is increasing it follows that <m>A</m> is decreasing at an increasing rate.
            Thus,
            <m>A</m> is concave up on <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(3,5)</m>.
            Analogous reasoning shows that <m>A</m> is concave down on <m>(1,3)</m> and <m>(5,6)</m>.
