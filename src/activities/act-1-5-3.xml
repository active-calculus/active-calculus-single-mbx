    <p permid="SEu">
      Researchers at a major car company have found a function that relates gasoline consumption to speed for a particular model of car.
      In particular,
      they have determined that the consumption <m>C</m>,
      in <em>liters per kilometer</em>,
      at a given speed <m>s</m>,
      is given by a function <m>C = f(s)</m>,
      where <m>s</m> is the car's speed in
      <em>kilometers per hour</em>.

            Data provided by the car company tells us that <m>f(80) = 0.015</m>,
            <m>f(90) = 0.02</m>, and <m>f(100) = 0.027</m>.
            Use this information to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of fuel consumption with respect to speed at <m>s = 90</m>.
            Be as accurate as possible,
            use proper notation, and include units on your answer.

            That is, at the given speed,

            it uses an additional 0.015 liters of fuel.

            To say that <m>f'(90) = 0.0006</m> liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour means that when the car is traveling at 90 kilometers per hour,
            its rate of fuel consumption per kilometer is increasing at a rate of 0.0006 liters per kilometer per kilometer per hour.
            If we increase our speed from 90 to 91 km/hr,
            we would expect our rate of fuel consumption to rise by 0.0006 liters for each additional kilometer driven.
