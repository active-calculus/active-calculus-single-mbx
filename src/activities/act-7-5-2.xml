  <solution>
    <p>
      <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          We will use the differential equation <m>\frac{dM}{dt} = -kM</m>, where <m>k</m> is a positive constant.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          With an initial condition of <m>M = M_0</m> when <m>t = 0</m>, the solution for the initial value problem is
          <me>
            M = M_0 e^{-kt}.
          </me>
          Using a half-life of 2 hours, we see that <m>M = \frac{1}{2} M_0</m> when <m>t = 2</m>.  This gives <m>\frac{1}{2}M_0 = M_0 e^{-2k}</m>, from which it follows that <m>k = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \approx 0.34657</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Noting that the rate of change of the drug in the body will be the differnce between the positive contributions of the dosage of 3 milligrams per hour and the decay of <m>kM</m> per hour, it follows that
          <m>\frac{dM}{dt} = 3 - kM</m>, where <m>k</m> is a positive constant.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          To find the equilibrium solutions, we solve the equation <m>\frac{dM}{dt} = 0</m>  for <m>M</m>.  This gives <m>M = \frac{3}{k}</m>.  The graph of <m>\frac{dM}{dt}</m> as a function of <m>M</m> is a straight line with a negative slope.  (The slope is <m>-k</m>.)  So when <m>M \lt  \frac{3}{k}</m>, <m>\frac{dM}{dt} \gt 0</m> and the <m>M</m> is an increasing function of <m>t</m>. When <m>M \gt \frac{3}{k}</m>, <m>\frac{dM}{dt} \lt  0</m> and the <m>M</m> is a decreasing function of <m>t</m>. This means that the equilibrium solution <m>mM = \frac{3}{k}</m> is a stable equilibrium solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use the initial condition <m>M = 0</m> when <m>t = 0</m> and solve the corresponding IVP.  Separating variables, 
          <me>
            \frac{1}{3 - kM} \frac{dM}{dt} = 1,
          </me>
          so 
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{3 - kM} dM = \int 1 dt,
          </me>
          and thus
          <me>
            -\frac{1}{k} \ln |3 - kM | = t + c.
          </me>
          Solving for <m>M</m> in the usual way gives us
          <me>
            M = \frac{1}{k} \left( 3 - Ae^{-kt} \right),
          </me>
          where <m>A</m> is a constant that arises from the integration constant.
          Using the initial condition, we obtain
          <m> 0 = \frac{1}{k} ( 3 - A)</m>, so <m>A = 3</m>.
          Hence, the solution to the initial condition problem is <m>M = \frac{1}{k} \left( 3 - 3e^{-kt} \right) = \frac{3}{k} \left( 1 - e^{-kt} \right)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We let <m>q</m> be the unknown intravenous rate of morphine (in milligrams per hour).  Notice that if we replace <m>3</m> with <m>q</m> in the differential equation and obtain <m>\frac{dM}{dt} = q - kM</m>, the solution process is the same and the equilibriume solution is <m>M = \frac{q}{k}</m>.  So if we want the equilibrium solution to be <m>M = 7</m>, we then have <m>\frac{q}{k} = 7</m>, so <m>q = 7k \approx 2.426</m>. The intravenous rate of morphine should be 2.426 milligrams per hour.
