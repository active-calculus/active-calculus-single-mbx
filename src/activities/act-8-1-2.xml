            Recall our earlier work with limits involving infinity in <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref>.
            State clearly what it means for a continuous function <m>f</m> to have a limit <m>L</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Given that an infinite sequence of real numbers is a function from the integers to the real numbers,
            apply the idea from part (a) to explain what you think it means for a sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> to have a limit as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Based on your response to the part (b),
            decide if the sequence
      <m>\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}</m> has a limit as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
            If so, what is the limit?
            If not, why not?

            A function <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as
            <m>x \to \infty</m> if we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by <m>\ldots</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Think about making <m>s_n</m> as close as you want to <m>L</m> for large values of <m>n</m>.

            A continuous function <m>f</m> has a limit <m>L</m> as the independent variable <m>x</m> goes to infinity if we can make the values of <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we want by choosing <m>x</m> as large as we need.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We expect that a sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> will have a limit <m>L</m> as <m>n</m> goes to infinity if we can make the entries <m>s_n</m> in the sequence as close to <m>L</m> as we want by choosing <m>n</m> as large as we need.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            As <m>n</m> gets large,
            the constant terms become infinitesimally small compared to <m>n</m> and so <m>\frac{1+n}{2+n}</m> looks like
            <m>\frac{n}{n}</m> or 1 for large <m>n</m>.
            So the sequence <m>\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}</m> has a limit of 1 at infinity.
