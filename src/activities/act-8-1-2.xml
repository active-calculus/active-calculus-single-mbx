        <li><p>Recall our earlier work with limits involving infinity in <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref>.  State clearly what it means for a continuous function <m>f</m> to have a limit <m>L</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Given that an infinite sequence of real numbers is a function from the integers to the real numbers, apply the idea from part (a) to explain what you think it means for a sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> to have a limit as <m>n \to \infty</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Based on your response to the part (b), decide if the sequence <m>\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}</m> has a limit as <m>n \to \infty</m>. If so, what is the limit? If not, why not?</p></li>

        <ol label="a.">
          <li><p>A continuous function <m>f</m> has a limit <m>L</m> as the independent variable <m>x</m> goes to infinity if we can make the values of <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we want by choosing <m>x</m> as large as we need.</p></li>

          <li><p>We expect that a sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> will have a limit <m>L</m> as <m>n</m> goes to infinity if we can make the entries <m>s_n</m> in the sequence as close to <m>L</m> as we want by choosing <m>n</m> as large as we need.</p></li>

          <li><p>As <m>n</m> gets large, the constant terms become infinitesimally small compared to <m>n</m> and so <m>\frac{1+n}{2+n}</m> looks like <m>\frac{n}{n}</m> or 1 for large <m>n</m>. So the sequence <m>\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}</m> has a limit of 1 at infinity.</p></li>
