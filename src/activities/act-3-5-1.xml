      A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone
      (point down)
      with a base of radius 6 feet and a depth of 8 feet.
      Suppose that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant instantaneous rate of 4 cubic feet per minute.

            Draw a picture of the conical tank,
            including a sketch of the water level at a point in time when the tank is not yet full.
            Introduce variables that measure the radius of the water's surface and the water's depth in the tank,
            and label them on your figure.

            Letting <m>r</m> represent the water's radius at time <m>t</m> and <m>h</m> the water's depth,
            we see the following situation:

        <li>
          <p>
            Observe that the right triangle with legs of length <m>h</m> and <m>r</m> is similar to the right triangle with legs of length <m>8</m> and <m>6</m>,
            respectively,
            based on how the water assumes the shape of the tank,
            and thus <m>\frac{r}{h} = \frac{6}{8}</m>,
            so that <m>r = \frac{3}{4}h</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since the water in the tank always takes the shape of a circular cone,
            the volume of water in the tank at time <m>t</m> is given by <m>V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h</m>.
            Because we have established that <m>r = \frac{3}{4}h</m>,
            it follows that
            <me>
              V = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{3}{4}h \right)^2 h = \frac{3}{16} \pi h^3
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Differentiating with respect to <m>t</m>, we now find
            <me>
              \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{9}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
            </me>,
            which relates the rates of change of <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            It is given in the problem setting that water is entering the tank at a rate of 4 cubic feet per minute,
            hence <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 4</m>,
            and we are interested in the rate of change of the water's depth when <m>h = 3</m>.
            Substituting these values into the equation that relates
            <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>, we find that
            <me>
              4 =  \frac{9}{16} \pi 3^2 \left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3}
            </me>,
            so that <m>\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3} = \frac{64}{81\pi} \approx 0.2515</m> feet per minute.
