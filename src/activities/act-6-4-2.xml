            A typical slice is a thin cylinder of radius 2 and thickness <m>\Delta x</m>.
            The volume of such a cylinder is
            <m>V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (2)^2 \Delta x</m>,
            and its weight is thus <m>F_{\text{slice}} = 1000 \cdot 9.8 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 4000 \pi \Delta x</m>.
            Finally,
            the distance such a slice travels to the top of the tank is <m>d_{\text{slice}} = x</m>.
            If we only pump out the top 1 m of water,
            it follows that the total work is
            <me permid="ueX">
              W = \int_{0}^{1} 9.8 \cdot 4000\pi \cdot x \, dx = 19600 \pi \, \text{newton-meters}

            Viewing the tank as a solid of revolution,
            the tank is generated by the function <m>R(x) = \sqrt{100-x^2}</m>,
            and a typical slice has volume <m>V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (\sqrt{100-x^2})^2 \Delta x</m>.
            The force to move such a slice is its weight,
            <m>F_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \pi (100-x^2) \Delta x</m>.
            Each slice has to move <m>x</m> feet to clear the top of the tank,
            and then an additional 5 feet up to the truck,
            so the distance each slice moves is <m>d_{\text{slice}} = x + 5</m>.
            Finally, since the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet,
            and we wish to pump out the top 5 feet,
            <m>x</m> ranges from <m>x=3</m>
            (the top of the water)
            to <m>x=8</m>
            (the point at which there are 2 feet remaining in the tank).
            Hence, the total work done is

            The line that bounds the right edge of the triangular face of the tank lying in the first quadrant is <m>y=\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x</m>.
            If we take a slice of water that lies at depth <m>x</m>,
            note that the slice is rectangular with thickness <m>\Delta x</m>,
            length 10
            (the tank is 10 feet long),
            and width <m>2(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x)</m>.
            Thus, the volume of a typical slice is

              V_{\text{slice}} = 10 \cdot 2(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x) \cdot \Delta x = (50 - \frac{25}{2}x) \Delta x

            The distance a typical slice moves when pumped to the top of the tank is <m>d_{\text{slice}} = x</m>,
            and since the tank is full to a depth of 3 feet (within 1 foot of the top) and we are going to empty the tank until 1 foot of water remains in it,
            we see that we need to integrate from <m>x=1</m> to <m>x=3</m>, so
