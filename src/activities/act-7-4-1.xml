<statement>
<p>
Suppose that the population of a town is growing continuously at an annual rate of 3<percent /> per year.
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Let <m>P(t)</m> be the population of the town in year <m>t</m>.  Write a
          differential equation that describes the annual growth rate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Find the solutions of this differential equation.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you know that the town's population in year 0 is 10,000, find
          the population <m>P(t)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>How long does it take for the population to double?  This time
          is called the <em>doubling time</em>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Working more generally, find the doubling time if the annual
          growth rate is <m>k</m> times the population.</p></li>
