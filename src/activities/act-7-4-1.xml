  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose that the population of a town is growing continuously at an annual rate of 3<percent /> per year.
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(t)</m> be the population of the town in year <m>t</m>.
            Write a differential equation that describes the annual growth rate.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Find the solutions of this differential equation.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If you know that the town's population in year 0 is 10,000,
            find the population <m>P(t)</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            How long does it take for the population to double?
            This time is called the <em>doubling time</em>.

        <li>

            Working more generally,
            find the doubling time if the annual growth rate is <m>k</m> times the population.

      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Since the population <m>P(t)</m> of the town is growing at an annual rate of <m>3\%</m> per year, this means that <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.03 P</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            We use separation of variables and write <m>\frac{1}{P} \frac{dP}{dt} = 1.03</m>.  We then have
            <me>
              \int \frac{1}{P} \frac{dP}{dt} dt \amp = \int 0.03 dt
            </me>
            and thus <m>\int \frac{1}{P} dP \amp = \int 0.03 dt</m>.  Evaluating the integrals on each side, we have
            <m>\ln|P| \amp = 0.03 t + c</m>
            By definition of the logarithm function, it follows that
            <me>
              |P| = e^{0.03t + c} = e^c e^{0.03t} = C e^{0.03t}.
            </me>
            Incorporating the <m>\pm</m> that follows from the abslute value sign into the constant <m>C</m>, we conclude that <m>P = Ce^{0.03t}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Given that <m>P(0) = 10000</m>, we see that <m>10000 = C e^0 = C</m>.  So
            <me>
              P = 10000 e^{0.03t}.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The population will have doubled when <m>P = 200000</m>.  To determine the time it takes the population to double, we solve the equation
            <me>
              10000 e^{0.03t} = 20000.
            </me>
            Thus <m>e^{0.03t} = 2</m>, so <m>t = \frac{\ln(2)}{0.03} \approx 23.105</m>.  It will take about 23.1 years for the population to double in size.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If the annual growth rate is <m>k</m>, then the differential equation for the population is
            <me>
              \frac{dP}{dt} = kP.
            </me>
            We can use separation of variables to show that <m>P = P_0 e^{kt}</m>, where <m>P_0</m> is the population at time <m>t = 0</m>.  We then find the doubling time by solving the equation <m>P_0 e^{kt} = 2P_0</m>.  We first solve for <m>e^{kt}</m> and get <m>e^{kt} = 2</m>.  Taking natural logs, <m>kt = \ln(2)</m>, and dividing by <m>k</m>, <m>t = \frac{1}{k} \ln(2)</m>.  The doubling time for the population is thus <m>\frac{1}{k} \ln(2)</m>.
