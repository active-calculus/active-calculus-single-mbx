    <p permid="Ckz">
      <m>A(1.19606) \approx 2.2018</m> is the absolute maximum cross-sectional area,

  </answer>
  <solution permid="Fff">
    <p permid="xAG">
      Once we choose the angle <m>\theta</m>,
      the two right triangles in the trapezoid are determined,
      and each has a horizontal leg of length
      <m>\cos(\theta)</m> and a vertical leg of length <m>\sin(\theta)</m>.
      Thus, the sum of the areas of the two triangles is <m>\sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)</m>,
      and the area of the rectangle between them is <m>2\sin(\theta)</m>.
      Hence, the area of the trapezoidal cross-section is <m>A(\theta) = \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) + 2 \sin(\theta)</m>.
      Because the length of the trough is constant,
      the trough's volume will be maximized by maximizing cross-sectional area.
      Note, too, that the domain for <m>\theta</m> is <m>0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="dHP">
      Differentiating, we find that
      <me permid="GUs">
        A'(\theta) = \sin(\theta) (-\sin(\theta)) + \cos(\theta) \cos(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta) = -\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JOY">
      Using the identity <m>\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)</m>,
      it follows that
      <me permid="nbB">
        A'(\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - 1 + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta) = 2\cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta) - 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pWh">
      This most recent equation is quadratic in <m>\cos(\theta)</m>,
      so letting <m>u = \cos(\theta)</m>,
      we can start to solve the equation
      <m>A'(\theta) = 0</m> by solving <m>2u^2 + 2u - 1 = 0</m>.
      Doing so, we find that
      <me permid="TiK">
        u = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.3660254, -1.3660254
      </me>,
      so only <m>u = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}</m> will be a potential value of the cosine function from an angle that lies in the interval <m>[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>.
      Now, recalling that <m>\cos(\theta) = u</m>,
      to find the critical number <m>\theta</m>,
      we solve <m>\cos(\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}</m>,
      which implies <m>\theta = \arccos(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}) \approx 1.19606</m> radians,
      or <m>\theta \approx 68.5292^\circ</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Wdq">
      Finally, to confirm that <m>A</m> has an absolute maximum at <m>\theta = \arccos(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}) \approx 1.19606</m>,
      we consider this value as well as the endpoints of <m>[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]</m>,
      and evaluate <m>A</m> to find that <m>A(0) = 0</m>,
      <m>A(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 2</m>,
      and <m>A(1.19606) \approx 2.2018</m>,
      which is the absolute maximum possible cross-sectional area.
