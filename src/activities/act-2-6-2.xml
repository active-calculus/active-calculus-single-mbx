      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>r(x) = \arctan(x)</m>,
            it is equivalent to write <m>\tan(r(x)) = x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Differentiating,
            we have <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(r(x))] = \frac{d}{dx}[x]</m>, so
            <me>
              \sec^2(r(x)) r'(x) = 1
            </me>,
            and thus
            <me>
              r'(x) = \frac{1}{\sec^2(r(x))} = \cos^2(r(x))
            </me>,
            since <m>\frac{1}{\sec(\alpha)} = \cos(\alpha)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>r(x) = \arctan(x)</m>,
            we now have that <m>r'(x) = \cos^2(\arctan(x))</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Letting <m>\theta = \arctan(x)</m>,
            it follows that we can view <m>\theta</m> as an angle in a right triangle with legs <m>1</m> and <m>x</m> (so that <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{1}</m>,
            and thus by the Pythagorean Theorem,
            the triangle's hypotenuse is <m>\sqrt{1+x^2}</m>,
      as shown below.

            <image source="images/2_6_cosarctan" />

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            To evaluate <m>\cos(\arctan(x))</m>,
            we use the right triangle developed in (d) and observe that
            <me>
              \cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Finally,
            we recall that we know <m>r'(x) = \cos^2(\arctan(x)) = \left( \cos(\arctan(x)) \right)^2</m>.
            Having established that <m>\cos(\arctan(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}</m>,
            we now have that
            <me>
              r'(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}
            </me>.
