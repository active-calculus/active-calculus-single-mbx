      We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x = a</m>,
      or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> at <m>x = a</m>,
      is given by the value <m>f'(a)</m>.
      In all of our examples so far,
      we have identified a particular value of <m>a</m> as our point of interest:
      <m>a = 1</m>, <m>a = 3</m>, etc.
      But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested in the derivative value for more than just one <m>a</m>-value,
      and possibly for many of them.
      In this section,
      we explore how we can move from computing the derivative at a single point to computing a formula for <m>f'(a)</m> at any point <m>a</m>.
      Indeed, the process of <q>taking the derivative</q>
      generates a new function,
      denoted by <m>f'(x)</m>, derived from the original function <m>f(x)</m>.

  <subsection permid="Lgq">
    <title>How the derivative is itself a function</title>
    <p permid="aZi">
      In your work in <xref ref="PA-1-4">Preview Activity</xref> with <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>,
      you may have found several patterns.
      One comes from observing that <m>f'(0) = 4</m>,
      <m>f'(1) = 2</m>, <m>f'(2) = 0</m>, and <m>f'(3) = -2</m>.
      That sequence of values leads us naturally to conjecture that
      <m>f'(4) = -4</m> and <m>f'(5) = -6</m>.
      We also observe that the particular value of <m>a</m> has very little effect on the process of computing the value of the derivative through the limit definition.
      To see this more clearly, we compute <m>f'(a)</m>,
      where <m>a</m> represents a number to be named later.
      Following the now standard process of using the limit definition of the derivative,
      <md permid="cOv">
        <mrow>f'(a) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4(a + h) - (a + h)^2 - (4a-a^2)}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4a + 4h - a^2 - 2ha - h^2 - 4a+a^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4h - 2ha - h^2}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h(4 - 2a - h)}{h} =  \lim_{h \to 0} (4 - 2a - h)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Hgr">
      Here we observe that neither <m>4</m> nor <m>2a</m> depend on the value of <m>h</m>,
      so as <m>h \to 0</m>, <m>(4 - 2a - h) \to (4 - 2a)</m>.
      Thus, <m>f'(a) = 4 - 2a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="nnA">
      This result is consistent with the specific values we found above:
      e.g., <m>f'(3) = 4 - 2(3) = -2</m>.
      And indeed, our work confirms that the value of <m>a</m> has almost no bearing on the process of computing the derivative.
      We note further that the letter being used is immaterial:
      whether we call it <m>a</m>,
      <m>x</m>, or anything else,
      the derivative at a given value is simply given by
      <q>4 minus 2 times the value.</q>
      We choose to use <m>x</m> for consistency with the original function given by <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      as well as for the purpose of graphing the derivative function.
      For the function <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>,
      it follows that <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="TuJ">
      Because the value of the derivative function is linked to the graph of the original function,
      it makes sense to look at both of these functions plotted on the same domain.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-4-ffprime" permid="QAd">
      <caption>The graphs of <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m> (at left) and <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m> (at right).  Slopes on the graph of <m>f</m> correspond to heights on the graph of <m>f'</m>.</caption>
      <image width="74%" source="images/1_4_ffprimeplot" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="zBS">
      In <xref ref="F-1-4-ffprime">Figure</xref>,
      on the left we show a plot of
      <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m> together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we've considered above.
      On the right, we show a plot of
      <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m> with emphasis on the heights of the derivative graph at the same selection of points.
      Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs:
      the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way:
      <em>the slope of the tangent line</em>
      at a point on the lefthand graph is the same as the <em>height</em>
      at the corresponding point on the righthand graph.
      That is, at each respective value of <m>x</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the height of the derivative function.
      Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different:
      in the left graph,
      the vertical units are simply the output units of <m>f</m>.
      On the righthand graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      the units on the vertical axis are units of <m>f</m> per unit of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="fJb">
      An excellent way to explore how the graph of <m>f(x)</m> generates the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> is through a java applet.

    <p permid="LQk">
      In <xref ref="sec-1-3-derivative-pt">Section</xref>
      when we first defined the derivative,
      we wrote the definition in terms of a value <m>a</m> to find <m>f'(a)</m>.
      As we have seen above, the letter <m>a</m> is merely a placeholder,
      and it often makes more sense to use <m>x</m> instead.
      For the record, here we restate the definition of the derivative.

          Let <m>f</m> be a function and <m>x</m> a value in the function's domain.
          We define the <term>derivative of <m>f</m></term>,
          a new function called <m>f'</m>,

          provided this limit exists.

    <p permid="rXt">
      We now have two different ways of thinking about the derivative function:

      <ol label="1" permid="vXs">
        <li permid="Fre">
          given a graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>,
          how does this graph lead to the graph of the derivative function

        <li permid="lyn">

        </li>
      </ol>

      Both of these issues are explored in the following activities.

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-1-4-1.xml" />

      Now, recall the opening example of this section:
      we began with the function
      <m>y = f(x) = 4x - x^2</m> and used the limit definition of the derivative to show that <m>f'(a) = 4 - 2a</m>,
      or equivalently that <m>f'(x) = 4 - 2x</m>.
      We subsequently graphed the functions <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> as shown in <xref ref="F-1-4-ffprime">Figure</xref>.
      Following <xref ref="act-1-4-1">Activity</xref>,
      we now understand that we could have constructed a fairly accurate graph of <m>f'(x)</m> <em>without</em>
      knowing a formula for either <m>f</m> or <m>f'</m>.
      At the same time,
      it is useful to know a formula for the derivative function whenever it is possible to find one.
    </p>

    <p permid="ksU">
      In the next activity,
      we further explore the more algebraic approach to finding <m>f'(x)</m>:
      given a formula for <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      the limit definition of the derivative will be used to develop a formula for <m>f'(x)</m>.

            It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function (<m>f</m>) and produces a new,
