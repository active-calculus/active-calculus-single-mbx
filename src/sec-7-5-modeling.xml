      We have seen several ways that differential equations arise in the natural world,
      from the growth of a population to the temperature of a cup of coffee.
      In this section,
      we look more closely at how differential equations give us a natural way to describe various phenoma.
      As we'll see,
      the key is to understand the different factors that cause a quantity to change.

      demonstrates the kind of thinking we will be doing in this section.
      In each of the two examples we considered, there is a quantity,
      such as the amount of money in the bank account or the amount of salt in the tank,
      that is changing due to several factors.
      The governing differential equation states that the total rate of change is the difference between the rate of increase and the rate of decrease.

    <example xml:id="Ex-7-5-1" permid="MBR">
      <statement>
        <p permid="qyo">
          In the Great Lakes region,
          rivers flowing into the lakes carry a great deal of pollution in the form of small pieces of plastic averaging 1 millimeter in diameter.
          In order to understand how the amount of plastic in Lake Michigan is changing,
          construct a model for how this type pollution has built up in the lake.

          First, some basic facts about Lake Michigan.

              <p permid="mTO">
                The volume of the lake is <m>5\cdot10^{12}</m> cubic meters.

              <p permid="TaX">
                Water flows into the lake at a rate of
                <m>5\cdot10^{10}</m> cubic meters per year.
                It flows out of the lake at the same rate.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li permid="ijV">
              <p permid="zig">
                Each cubic meter flowing into the lake contains roughly
                <m>3\cdot10^{-8}</m> cubic meters of plastic pollution.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p permid="XKQ">
          Let's denote the amount of pollution in the lake by <m>P(t)</m>,
          where <m>P</m> is measured in cubic meters of plastic and <m>t</m> in years.
          Our goal is to describe the rate of change of this function;
          so
          we want to develop a differential equation describing <m>P(t)</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="DRZ">
          First, we will measure how <m>P(t)</m> increases due to pollution flowing
          into the lake.
          We know that <m>5\cdot10^{10}</m> cubic meters of water
          enters the lake every year and each cubic meter of water contains
          <m>3\cdot10^{-8}</m> cubic meters of pollution.
          Therefore, pollution
          enters the lake at the rate of
          <me permid="zSa">
            \left(5\cdot 10^{10} \frac{m^3 \text{ water} }{\text{year} }\right) \left(3\cdot10^{-8} \frac{m^3 \text{ plastic} }{m^3 \text{ water} } \right) = 1.5\cdot 10^3
            \text{cubic m of plastic per year}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="jZi">
          Second, we will measure how <m>P(t)</m> decreases due to pollution flowing
          out of the lake.
          If the total amount of pollution is <m>P</m> cubic
          meters and the volume of Lake Michigan is <m>5\cdot 10^{12}</m> cubic
          meters,
          then the concentration of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan is
          <me permid="fZj">
            \frac{P}{5\cdot10^{12}}  \text{cubic m of plastic per cubic m of water}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Qgr">
          Since <m>5\cdot10^{10}</m> cubic meters of water flow out each year<fn>
          and we assume that each cubic meter of water that flows out carries with it the plastic pollution it contains
          </fn>, then
          the plastic pollution leaves the lake at the rate of
          <me permid="Mgs">
            \left(\frac{P}{5\cdot10^{12}} \frac{m^3 \text{ plastic} }{m^3 \text{ water} } \right) \left(5\cdot10^{10} \frac{m^3 \text{ water} }{\text{year} } \right)=\frac{P}{100}
            \text{cubic m of plastic per year}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="wnA">
          The total rate of change of <m>P</m> is thus the difference between the rate at which
          pollution enters the lake and the rate at which pollution leaves the
          lake; that is,
          <md permid="snB">
            <mrow>\frac{dP}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5\cdot10^{3}-\frac{P}{100}</mrow>

          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="cuJ">
          We have now found a differential equation that describes the rate at which the amount of pollution is changing.
          To understand the behavior of <m>P(t)</m>,
          we apply some of the techniques we have recently developed.
        </p>

        <p permid="IBS">
          Because the differential equation is autonomous,
          we can sketch <m>dP/dt</m> as a function of <m>P</m> and then construct a slope field,
          as shown in <xref ref="F-7-5-Ex1-plot">Figure</xref>
          and <xref ref="F-7-5-Ex1-slope-field">Figure</xref>.

          These plots both show that
          <m>P=1.5\cdot10^5</m> is a stable equilibrium.
          Therefore, we should expect that the amount of pollution in Lake Michigan will stabilize near
          <m>1.5\cdot10^5</m> cubic meters of pollution.
        </p>

        <p permid="UQk">
          Next, assuming that there is initially no pollution in the lake, we will
          solve the initial value problem

          Separating variables, we find that

          and thus changing variables on the left and antidifferentiating on both sides,
          we find that

        <p permid="NlL">
          Finally, multiplying both sides by <m>-1</m> and using the definition of the logarithm,

            1.5\cdot10^5 - P = C e^{-t/100}

        <p permid="tsU">
          This is a good time to determine the constant <m>C</m>.
          Since <m>P =

          <me permid="deD">

          Using this value of <m>C</m> in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E-7-5-Ex1C" /> and solving for <m>P</m>,

        <p permid="RVE">

    <p permid="iTP">
      There are many important lessons to learn from <xref ref="Ex-7-5-1">Example</xref>.
      Foremost is how we can develop a differential equation by thinking about the
      <q>total rate = rate in - rate out</q> model.
      In addition,
      we note how we can bring together all of our available understanding
      (plotting <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> vs. <m>P</m>,
      creating a slope field, solving the differential equation)
      to see how the differential equation describes the behavior of a changing quantity.
    </p>

    <p permid="PaY">
      We can also explore what happens when certain aspects of the problem change.
      For instance,
      let's suppose we are at a time when the plastic pollution entering Lake Michigan has stabilized at <m>1.5\cdot10^5</m> cubic meters,
      and that new legislation is passed to prevent this type of pollution entering the lake.
      So, there is no longer any inflow of plastic pollution to the lake.
      How does the amount of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan now change?
      For example,
      how long does it take for the amount of plastic pollution in the lake to halve?
    </p>

    <p permid="vih">
      Resetting <m>t=0</m> at this time,
      we now have the initial value problem
      <me permid="psV">
        \frac{dP}{dt} = -\frac{1}{100}P, \ P(0) = 1.5\cdot10^5
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="bpq">
      It is a straightforward and familiar exercise to find that the solution to this equation is <m>P(t) = 1.5\cdot10^5
      e^{-t/100}</m>.
      The time that it takes for half of the pollution to flow
      out of the lake is given by <m>T</m> where <m>P(T) = 0.75\cdot10^5</m>.
      Thus, we must solve the equation
      <me permid="VAe">
        0.75\cdot10^5 = 1.5\cdot10^5e^{-T/100}
      </me>,
      or
      <me permid="BHn">
        \frac12 = e^{-T/100}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Hwz">
      It follows that
      <me permid="hOw">
        T = -100\,\ln\left(\frac12\right) \approx 69.3 \text{years.}
      </me>

      we explore some other natural settings in which differential equations model changing quantities.
