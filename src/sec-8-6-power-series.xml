  <introduction permid="NHK">
    <p permid="mUo">
      We have noted in our work with Taylor polynomials and Taylor series that polynomial functions are the simplest possible functions in mathematics,
      in part because they require only addition and multiplication to evaluate.
      From the point of view of calculus,
      polynomials are especially nice:
      we can easily differentiate or integrate any polynomial.
      In light of our work in <xref ref="sec-8-5-taylor">Section</xref>,
      we now know that several important non-polynomials have polynomial-like expansions.
      For example, for any real number <m>x</m>,
      <me permid="AXT">
        e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!} + \cdots
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Tbx">
      There are two settings where other series like the one for <m>e^x</m> arise:
      we may be given an expression such as
      <me permid="hfc">
        1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \cdots
      </me>
      and we seek the values of <m>x</m> for which the expression makes sense.
      Or we may be trying to find an unknown function <m>f</m> that has expression
      <me permid="Nml">
        f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_k x^k + \cdots
      </me>,
      and we try to determine the values of the constants <m>a_0</m>,
      <m>a_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>.
      The latter situation is explored in <xref ref="PA-8-6">Preview Activity</xref>.

    <p permid="ziG">
      As <xref ref="PA-8-6">Preview Activity</xref> shows,
      it can be useful to treat an unknown function as if it has a Taylor series,
      and then determine the coefficients from other information.
      In other words,
      we define a function as an infinite series of powers of <m>x</m> and then determine the coefficients based on something besides a formula for the function.
      This method allows us to approximate solutions to many different types of differential equations,
      even if we cannot solve them explicitly.
      This is different from our work with Taylor series since we are not using an original function <m>f</m> to generate
      the coefficients of the series.

          A <term>power series</term>

    <p permid="fpP">
      A power series defines a function <m>f</m> whose domain is the set of <m>x</m> values for which the power series converges.
      We therefore write
      <me permid="ZAD">
        f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k(x-a)^k

      It turns out that<fn>
      See <xref ref="ex-8-5-2">Exercise</xref> in this section.
      </fn>,
      on its interval of convergence,
      every power series is in fact the Taylor series of the function it defines,
      so all of the techniques we developed in the previous section can be applied to power series as well.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-8-6-1" permid="pfa">
      <statement>
        <p permid="OrE">
          Consider the power series defined by
          <me permid="FHM">
            f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{2^k}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="uyN">
          What are <m>f(1)</m> and <m>f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>?

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="tOT">
        <p permid="UgQ">
          If we evaluate <m>f</m> at <m>x=1</m> we obtain the series
          <me permid="lOV">
            \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k}
          </me>
          which is a geometric series with ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
          So we can sum this series and find that
          <me permid="RWe">
            f(1) = \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 2
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="AnZ">
          Similarly,
          <me permid="ydn">
            f(3/2) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^k = \frac{1}{1-\frac{3}{4}} = 4
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="gvi">
          In general,
          <m>f(x)</m> is a geometric series with ratio <m>\frac{x}{2}</m>, so
          <me permid="ekw">
            f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^k = \frac{1}{1-\frac{x}{2}} = \frac{2}{2-x}
          </me>
          provided that <m>-1 \lt  \frac{x}{2} \lt  1</m>
          (which ensures that the ratio is less than 1 in absolute value).
          Thus, the power series that defines
          <m>f(x)=\frac{2}{2-x}</m> converges for <m>-2 \lt  x \lt  2</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="rEh">
      As we did for Taylor series,
      we define the interval of convergence of a power series <xref ref="eq-8-6-power-series" /> to be the set of values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges.
      And as we did with Taylor series,
      we typically use the Ratio Test to find the values of <m>x</m> for which the power series converges absolutely,
      and then check the endpoints separately if the radius of convergence is finite.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-8-6-2" permid="Vmj">
      <statement>
        <p permid="aFW">

      </statement>
      <solution permid="ZWc">
        <p permid="MCr">
          First we will plot some of the partial sums of this power series to get an idea of the interval of convergence.
          Let
          <me permid="KrF">
            S_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{x^k}{k^2}

          <xref ref="F-8-6-Power-Series">Figure</xref>
          shows plots of <m>S_{10}(x)</m>
          (in red),
          <m>S_{25}(x)</m>
          (in blue),
          and <m>S_{50}(x)</m>
          (in green).

        </figure>

        <p permid="sJA">
          The behavior of <m>S_{50}</m> in particular suggests that <m>f(x)</m> appears to be converging to a particular curve on the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>,
          while growing without bound outside of that interval.
          Thus, the interval of convergence might be <m>-1 \lt  x \lt  1</m>.
          To verify our conjecture,
          we apply the Ratio Test.
          Now,
          <me permid="qyO">
            a_k = \frac{x^k}{k^2}
          </me>,
          so
          <md permid="WFX">
            <mrow>\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\left| a_{k+1} \right|}{ \left| a_k \right|} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{|x|^{k+1}}{(k+1)^2} }{ \frac{| x|^{k}}{k^2} }</mrow>

          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="YQJ">
          Therefore, the Ratio Test tells us that <m>f(x)</m> converges absolutely when
          <m>| x | \lt 1</m> and diverges when <m>| x | \gt 1</m>.
          Because the Ratio Test is inconclusive when <m>|x| = 1</m>,
          we need to check <m>x = 1</m> and <m>x = -1</m> individually.
        </p>

        <p permid="EXS">
          When <m>x = 1</m>, observe that

        <p permid="lfb">
          This is a <m>p</m>-series with <m>p \gt 1</m>, which we know converges.

        <p permid="Rmk">
          This is an alternating series,
          and since the sequence <m>\left\{ \frac{1}{n^2} \right\}</m> decreases to 0, the power series converges by the Alternating Series Test.
          Thus, the interval of convergence of this power series is <m>-1 \le x \le 1</m>.

          converges both when <m>x = -1</m> and when <m>x = 1</m>;
          in each case, we have an alternating series with terms
          <m>\frac{1}{2k+1}</m> that decrease to <m>0</m>,
          and thus the interval of convergence for the series expansion for
          <m>\arctan(x)</m> in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E-arctanseries" /> is <m>-1 \le x \le 1</m>.

            We can often assume a solution to a given problem can be written as a power series,
            then use the information in the problem to determine the coefficients in the power series.
            This method allows us to approximate solutions to certain problems using partial sums of the power series;
            that is,
            we can find approximate solutions that are polynomials.

            The connection between power series and Taylor series is that they are essentially the same thing:
            on its interval of convergence a power series is the Taylor series of its sum.
