    <p>
      The growth of the earth's population is one of the pressing issues of our time.
      Will the population continue to grow?
      Or will it perhaps level off at some point, and if so, when?
      In this section,
      we look at two ways in which we may use differential equations to help us address these questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we begin,
      let's consider again two important differential equations that we have seen in earlier work this chapter.
    </p>

    <title>The earth's population</title>
    <p>
      We will now begin studying the earth's population.
      To get started, in <xref ref="T-7-6-earth">Table</xref>
      are some data for the earth's population in recent years that we will use in our investigations.

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-7-6-1.xml" />

    <p>
      Our work in <xref ref="act-7-6-1">Activity</xref>
      shows that that the exponential model is fairly accurate for years relatively close to 2000.
      However, if we go too far into the future,
      the model predicts increasingly large rates of change,
      which causes the population to grow arbitrarily large.
      This does not make much sense since it is unrealistic to expect that the earth would be able to support such a large population.
    </p>

    <p>
      The constant <m>k</m> in the differential equation has an important
      interpretation.
      Let's rewrite the differential equation
      <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</m> by solving for <m>k</m>, so that we have
      <me>
        k = \frac{dP/dt}{P}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We see that
      <m>k</m> is the ratio of the rate of change to the population;
      in other words, it is the contribution to the rate of change from a single person.
      We call this the <em>per capita growth rate</em>.
          <idx><h>per capita growth rate</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the exponential model we introduced in <xref ref="act-7-6-1">Activity</xref>,
      the per capita growth rate is constant.
      This means that when the population is large,
      the per capita growth rate is the same as when the population is small.
      It is natural to think that the per capita growth rate should decrease when the population becomes large,
      since there will not be enough resources to support so many people.
      We expect it would be a more realistic model to assume that the per capita growth rate depends on the population <m>P</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the previous activity,
      we computed the per capita growth rate in a single year by computing <m>k</m>,
      the quotient of <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> and <m>P</m> (which we did for <m>t = 0</m>).
      If we return to the data in <xref ref="T-7-6-earth">Table</xref>
      and compute the per capita growth rate over a range of years,
      we generate the data shown in <xref ref="F-7-6-census">Figure</xref>,
      which shows how the per capita growth rate is a function of the population,
      <m>P</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-7-6-census">
      <caption>A plot of per capita growth rate vs.<nbsp />population <m>P</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/7_6_census" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      From the data,
      we see that the per capita growth rate appears to decrease as the population increases.
      In fact, the points seem to lie very close to a line,
      which is shown at two different scales in <xref ref="F-7-6-census1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-7-6-census1">
      <caption>The line that approximates per capita growth as a function of population, <m>P</m>.</caption>
      <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
        <image source="images/7_6_census_1" />
        <image source="images/7_6_census_2" />
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Looking at this line carefully,
      we can find its equation to be
      <me>
        \frac{dP/dt}{P} = 0.025 - 0.002P
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we multiply both sides by <m>P</m>,
      we arrive at the differential
      equation
      <me>
        \frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Graphing the dependence of <m>dP/dt</m> on the population <m>P</m>,
      we see that this differential equation demonstrates a quadratic relationship between <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> and <m>P</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="F-7-6logistic">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-7-6logistic">
      <caption>A plot of <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> vs.<nbsp /><m>P</m> for the differential equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/7_6_logistic_de" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      The equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)</m> is an example of the
      <em>logistic equation</em>,
      and is the second model for population growth that we will consider.
      We expect that it will be more realistic, because the per capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the population.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, the graph in <xref ref="F-7-6logistic">Figure</xref>
      shows that there are two equilibrium solutions, <m>P=0</m>,
      which is unstable, and <m>P=12.5</m>,
      which is a stable equilibrium.
      The graph shows that any solution with
      <m>P(0) \gt 0</m> will eventually stabilize around 12.5.
      Thus, our model predicts the world's population will eventually stabilize around 12.5 billion.
    </p>

    <p>
      A prediction for the long-term behavior of the population is a valuable conclusion to draw from our differential equation.
      We would, however, also like to answer some quantitative questions.
      For instance,
      how long will it take to reach a population of 10 billion?
      To answer this question, we need to find an explicit solution of the equation.
    </p>

    <title>Solving the logistic differential equation</title>
    <idx><h>logistic</h></idx>

    <p>
      Since we would like to apply the logistic model in more general situations,
      we state the logistic equation
          <idx><h>logistic equation</h></idx>
      in its more general form,
      <men xml:id="E-7-6-logistic">
        \frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P)
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The equilibrium solutions here are <m>P=0</m> and <m>1-\frac PN = 0</m>,
      which shows that <m>P=N</m>.
      The equilibrium at <m>P=N</m> is called the
      <em>carrying capacity</em>
          <idx><h>carrying capacity</h></idx>
      of the population for it represents the stable population that can be sustained by the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now solve the logistic equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E-7-6-logistic" />.
      The equation is separable, so we separate the variables
      <me>
        \frac{1}{P(N-P)}\frac{dP}{dt} = k
      </me>,
      and integrate to find that
      <me>
        \int \frac{1}{P(N-P)}~dP = \int k~dt
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To find the antiderivative on the left,
      we use the partial fraction decomposition
      <me>
        \frac{1}{P(N-P)} = \frac 1N\left[\frac 1P + \frac 1{N-P}\right]
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we are ready to integrate, with
      <me>
        \int \frac 1N\left[\frac 1P + \frac 1{N-P}\right] ~dP  =  \int k~dt
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the left, observe that <m>N</m> is constant,
      so we can remove a factor of
      <m>\frac{1}{N}</m> and antidifferentiate to find that
      <me>
        \frac 1N (\ln|P| - \ln|N-P|)  =  kt + C
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiplying both sides of this last equation by <m>N</m> and using a rule of logarithms,
      we next find that
      <me>
        \ln\left|\frac{P}{N-P}\right| = kNt + C
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the definition of the logarithm,
      replacing <m>e^C</m> with <m>C</m>,
      and letting <m>C</m> absorb the absolute value signs,
      we now know that
      <me>
        \frac{P}{N-P} =  Ce^{kNt}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point,
      all that remains is to determine <m>C</m> and solve algebraically for <m>P</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the initial population is <m>P(0) = P_0</m>,
      then it follows that <m>C = \frac{P_0}{N-P_0}</m>, so
      <me>
        \frac{P}{N-P} = \frac{P_0}{N-P_0}e^{kNt}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will solve this equation for <m>P</m> by multiplying both sides by
      <m>(N-P)(N-P_0)</m> to obtain
      <md>
        <mrow>P(N-P_0) &amp;=  P_0(N-P)e^{kNt}</mrow>
        <mrow>   &amp;=  P_0Ne^{kNt} - P_0Pe^{kNt}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Solving for <m>P_0Ne^{kNt}</m>,
      expanding, and factoring, it follows that
      <md>
        <mrow>P_0Ne^{kNt} &amp;=  P(N-P_0) + P_0 Pe^{kNt}</mrow>
        <mrow>   &amp;=  P(N-P_0 + P_0e^{kNt})</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dividing to solve for <m>P</m>, we see that
      <me>
        P = \frac{P_0Ne^{kNt}}{N-P_0 + P_0e^{kNt}}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we choose to multiply the numerator and denominator by <m>\frac{1}{P_0}e^{-kNt}</m>
      to obtain
      <me>
        P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While that was a lot of algebra,
      notice the result: we have
      found an explicit solution to the logistic equation.

    <p>
      For the logistic equation describing the earth's population that we worked with earlier in this section, we have
      <me>
        k=0.002,  N= 12.5,  \text{and}   P_0 = 6.084
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gives the solution
      <me>
        P(t) = \frac{12.5}{1.0546e^{-0.025t} + 1}
      </me>,
      whose graph is shown in <xref ref="F-7-6-logistic-sol">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-7-6-logistic-sol">
      <caption>The solution to the logistic equation modeling the earth's population.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/7_6_logistic_sol" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      The graph shows the population leveling off at 12.5 billion,
      as we expected,
      and that the population will be around 10 billion in the year 2050.
      These results,
      which we have found using a relatively simple mathematical model,
      agree fairly well with predictions made using a much more sophisticated model developed by the United Nations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The logistic equation is good for modeling any situation in which limited growth is possible.
      For instance,
      it could model the spread of a flu virus through a population contained on a cruise ship,
      the rate at which a rumor spreads within a small town,
      or the behavior of an animal population on an island.
     Through our work in this section,
      we have completely solved the logistic equation,
      regardless of the values of the constants <m>N</m>, <m>k</m>,
      and <m>P_0</m>.
      Anytime we encounter a logistic equation,
      we can apply the formula we found in Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E-7-6-logistic-solution" />.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we assume that the rate of growth of a population is proportional to the population,
            we are led to a model in which the population grows without bound and at a rate that grows without bound.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            By assuming that the per capita growth rate decreases as the population grows,
            we are led to the logistic model of population growth,
            which predicts that the population will eventually stabilize at the carrying capacity.
