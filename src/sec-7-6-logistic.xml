      The growth of the earth's population is one of the pressing issues of our time.
      Will the population continue to grow?
      Or will it perhaps level off at some point, and if so, when?
      In this section,
      we look at two ways in which we may use differential equations to help us address these questions.

      Before we begin,
      let's consider again two important differential equations that we have seen in earlier work this chapter.

    <p permid="MQm">
      Our work in <xref ref="act-7-6-1">Activity</xref>
      shows that that the exponential model is fairly accurate for years relatively close to 2000.
      However, if we go too far into the future,
      the model predicts increasingly large rates of change,
      which causes the population to grow arbitrarily large.
      This does not make much sense since it is unrealistic to expect that the earth would be able to support such a large population.
    </p>

    <p permid="sXv">
      The constant <m>k</m> in the differential equation has an important
      interpretation.
      Let's rewrite the differential equation
      <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</m> by solving for <m>k</m>, so that we have
      <me permid="FVH">
        k = \frac{dP/dt}{P}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ZeE">
      We see that
      <m>k</m> is the ratio of the rate of change to the population;
      in other words,
      it is the contribution to the rate of change from a single person.
      We call this the <em>per capita growth rate</em>.
          <idx><h>per capita growth rate</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p permid="FlN">
      In the exponential model we introduced in <xref ref="act-7-6-1">Activity</xref>,
      the per capita growth rate is constant.
      This means that when the population is large,
      the per capita growth rate is the same as when the population is small.
      It is natural to think that the per capita growth rate should decrease when the population becomes large,
      since there will not be enough resources to support so many people.
      We expect it would be a more realistic model to assume that the per capita growth rate depends on the population <m>P</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="lsW">
      In the previous activity,
      we computed the per capita growth rate in a single year by computing <m>k</m>,
      the quotient of <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> and <m>P</m>
      (which we did for <m>t = 0</m>).
      If we return to the data in <xref ref="T-7-6-earth">Table</xref>
      and compute the per capita growth rate over a range of years,
      we generate the data shown in <xref ref="F-7-6-census">Figure</xref>,
      which shows how the per capita growth rate is a function of the population,
      <m>P</m>.
    </p>

    <figure permid="iyq" xml:id="F-7-6-census">
      <caption>A plot of per capita growth rate vs.<nbsp />population <m>P</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/7_6_census" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="RAf">
      From the data,
      we see that the per capita growth rate appears to decrease as the population increases.
      In fact, the points seem to lie very close to a line,
      which is shown at two different scales in <xref ref="F-7-6-census1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure permid="OFz" xml:id="F-7-6-census1">
      <caption>The line that approximates per capita growth as a function of population, <m>P</m>.</caption>
      <sidebyside permid="SFy" widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
        <image source="images/7_6_census_1" />
        <image source="images/7_6_census_2" />
      </sidebyside>

    </figure>

    <p permid="xHo">
      Looking at this line carefully,
      we can find its equation to be
      <me permid="mcQ">
        \frac{dP/dt}{P} = 0.025 - 0.002P
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="dOx">
      If we multiply both sides by <m>P</m>,
      we arrive at the differential
      equation
      <me permid="SjZ">
        \frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JVG">
      Graphing the dependence of <m>dP/dt</m> on the population <m>P</m>,
      we see that this differential equation demonstrates a quadratic relationship between <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> and <m>P</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="F-7-6logistic">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure permid="uMI" xml:id="F-7-6logistic">
      <caption>A plot of <m>\frac{dP}{dt}</m> vs.<nbsp /><m>P</m> for the differential equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)</m>.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/7_6_logistic_de" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="qcP">
      The equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)</m> is an example of the
      <em>logistic equation</em>,
      and is the second model for population growth that we will consider.
      We expect that it will be more realistic,
      because the per capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the population.
    </p>

    <p permid="WjY">
      Indeed, the graph in <xref ref="F-7-6logistic">Figure</xref>
      shows that there are two equilibrium solutions, <m>P=0</m>,
      which is unstable, and <m>P=12.5</m>,
      which is a stable equilibrium.
      The graph shows that any solution with
      <m>P(0) \gt 0</m> will eventually stabilize around 12.5.
      Thus, our model predicts the world's population will eventually stabilize around 12.5 billion.
    </p>

    <p permid="Crh">
      A prediction for the long-term behavior of the population is a valuable conclusion to draw from our differential equation.
      We would, however, also like to answer some quantitative questions.
      For instance,
      how long will it take to reach a population of 10 billion?
      To answer this question,
      we need to find an explicit solution of the equation.

    <p permid="nij">
      We now solve the logistic equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E-7-6-logistic" />.
      The equation is separable, so we separate the variables
      <me permid="eyr">
        \frac{1}{P(N-P)}\frac{dP}{dt} = k
      </me>,
      and integrate to find that

    <p permid="Tps">
      To find the antiderivative on the left,

    <p permid="zwB">

    <p permid="XZl">

      If the initial population is <m>P(0) = P_0</m>,

      The logistic equation is good for modeling any situation in which limited growth is possible.
