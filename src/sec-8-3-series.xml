      In <xref ref="sec-8-2-geometric">Section</xref>,
      we encountered infinite geometric series.
      For example, by writing
      <me permid="NHx">
        N = 0.1212121212 \cdots = \frac{12}{100} + \frac{12}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{100} + \frac{12}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{100^2} + \cdots
      </me>
      as a geometric series,
      we found a way to write  <m>N</m> as a single fraction:
      <m>N = \frac{4}{33}</m>.
      In this section,
      we explore other types of infinite sums.
      In <xref ref="PA-8-3">Preview Activity</xref>
      we see how one such sum is related to the famous number <m>e</m>.

      Is it even possible to sum an infinite list of numbers?

      The definite integral is the sum of an infinite collections of numbers,
      and we have already examined the special case of geometric series in the previous section.
      As we investigate other infinite sums,
      there are two key questions we seek to answer:  
      (1) is the sum finite? and (2) if yes, what is its value?

    <p permid="MXD">
      The example in <xref ref="act-8-3-1">Activity</xref>
      illustrates how we define the sum of an infinite series.
      We construct a new sequence of numbers (called the

          <idx><h>partial sum</h></idx>
          <idx><h>sequence of partial sums</h></idx>
      where the <m>n</m>th term in the sequence consists of the sum of the first <m>n</m> terms of the series.
      If this sequence converges,
      the corresponding infinite series is said to converge,

      where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers
      (and <m>r \ne 1</m>).

    <title>The Divergence Test</title>

      The first question we ask about any infinite series is usually
      <q>Does the series converge or diverge?</q>
      There is a straightforward way to check that certain series diverge, and

    <p permid="qkg">
      It is logically equivalent to say that if the sequence <m>\{a_k\}</m> does not converge to 0, then the series <m>\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} a_k</m> cannot converge.

      <em>Note well:</em> be very careful with the Divergence Test.

      indeed, as we will soon see,
      a series whose terms go to zero may either converge or diverge.

      The Integral Test allows us to determine the convergence of an entire family of series:
      the <m>p</m>-series.
      However, we have seen that it is often
      difficult to integrate functions,
      so the Integral Test is not one that we can use all of the time.
      In fact, even for a relatively simple series such as <m>\sum \frac{k^2+1}{k^4+2k+2}</m>,
      the Integral Test is not an option.
      In what follows we develop a test that applies to series of rational functions by comparing their behavior to the behavior of <m>p</m>-series.

      illustrates how we can compare one series with positive terms to another whose 
      convergence status we know.
      Suppose we have two series <m>\sum a_k</m> and
      <m>\sum b_k</m> with positive terms and we know the convergence status of the series <m>\sum a_k</m>.
      Recall that the convergence or divergence of a series depends only on the terms of the series for large values of <m>k</m>,
      so if we know that <m>a_k</m> and <m>b_k</m> are proportional for large <m>k</m>,
      then the two series <m>\sum a_k</m> and
      <m>\sum b_k</m> should behave the same way.
      In other words,
      if there is a positive finite constant <m>c</m> such that
      <me permid="EXF">
        \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{b_k}{a_k} = c
      </me>,
      then <m>b_k \approx ca_k</m> for large values of <m>k</m>.
      So
      <me permid="leO">
        \sum b_k \approx \sum ca_k = c  \sum a_k
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="kuU">
      Since multiplying by a nonzero constant does not affect the convergence or divergence of a series,
      it follows that the series <m>\sum a_k</m> and
      <m>\sum b_k</m> either both converge or both diverge.
      The formal statement of this fact is called the Limit Comparison Test.

      The Limit Comparison Test shows that if we have a series

      then the series <m>\sum \frac{p(k)}{q(k)}</m> will behave like the series <m>\sum \frac{k^m}{k^l}</m>.
      So this test allows us to determine the convergence or divergence of series whose terms are rational functions.
