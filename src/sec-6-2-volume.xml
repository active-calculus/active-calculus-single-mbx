    <title>The Volume of a Solid of Revolution</title>
    <idx><h>solid of revolution</h></idx>

    <p permid="OxV">
      A solid of revolution is a three dimensional solid that can be generated by revolving one or more curves around a fixed axis.
      For example,
      the circular cone in <xref ref="F-PA-6-2">Figure</xref>
      is the solid of revolution generated by revolving the portion of the line
      <m>y = 3 - \frac{3}{5}x</m> from <m>x = 0</m> to <m>x = 5</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Notice that if we slice a solid of revolution perpendicular to the axis of revolution,
      the resulting cross-section is a circle.
    </p>

    <p permid="uFe">
      We first consider solids whose slices are thin cylinders.
      Recall that the volume of a cylinder is given by <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>.

          When we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis,
          we get the three-dimensional solid pictured in <xref ref="F-6-2-Ex1">Figure</xref>.

        <p permid="KTv">
          We slice the solid into vertical slices of thickness
          <m>\Delta x</m> between <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 2</m>.
          A representative slice is a cylinder of height
          <m>\Delta x</m> and radius <m>4-x^2</m>.
          Hence, the volume of the slice is

    <p permid="aMn">
      For a solid such as the one in <xref ref="Ex-6-2-Disks">Example</xref>,
      where each slice is a cylindrical disk,
      we first find the volume of a typical slice
      (noting particularly how this volume depends on <m>x</m>),
      and then integrate over the range of <m>x</m>-values that bound the solid.
      Often, we will be content with simply finding the integral that represents the volume;
      if we desire a numeric value for the integral,
      we typically use a calculator or computer algebra system to find that value.

      A different type of solid can emerge when two curves are involved,

      <solution permid="Eup">
        <p permid="jwf">
          First, we must determine where the curves
          <m>y = 4-x^2</m> and <m>y = x+2</m> intersect.
          Substituting the expression for <m>y</m> from the second equation into the first equation,
          we find that <m>x + 2 = 4-x^2</m>.
          Rearranging, it follows that
          <me permid="wur">
            x^2 + x - 2 = 0

          and the solutions to this equation are <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.
          The curves therefore cross at <m>(-2,0)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>.

        <p permid="PDo">
          When we revolve the region <m>R</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis,
          we get the three-dimensional solid pictured at left in <xref ref="F-6-2-Ex2">Figure</xref>.

          Immediately we see a major difference between the solid in this example and the one in <xref ref="Ex-6-2-Disks">Example</xref>:
          here, the three-dimensional solid of revolution isn't <q>solid</q>
          because it has open space in its center along the axis of revolution.
          If we slice the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution,
          we observe that the resulting slice is not a solid disk,
          but rather a <em>washer</em>,
          as pictured at right in <xref ref="F-6-2-Ex2">Figure</xref>.
          At a given location <m>x</m> between <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 1</m>,
          the small radius <m>r(x)</m> of the inner circle is determined by the curve <m>y = x+2</m>,
          so <m>r(x) = x+2</m>.
          Similarly, the big radius <m>R(x)</m> comes from the function <m>y = 4-x^2</m>,
          and thus <m>R(x) = 4-x^2</m>.

        <p permid="bRG">
          To find the volume of a representative slice,
