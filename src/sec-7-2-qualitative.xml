    <p permid="GjP">
      In earlier work, we have used the tangent line to the graph of a
      function <m>f</m> at a point <m>a</m> to approximate the values of <m>f</m> near <m>a</m>.
      The usefulness of this approximation is that we need to know very
      little about the function;
      armed with only the value <m>f(a)</m> and the
      derivative <m>f'(a)</m>,
      we may find the equation of the tangent line and
      the approximation
      <me permid="AuD">
        f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="mqY">
      Remember that a first-order differential equation gives us information about the derivative of an unknown function.
      Since the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line at this point,
      a differential equation gives us crucial information about the tangent lines to the graph of a solution.
      We will use this information about the tangent lines to create a <em>slope field</em>
      for the differential equation,
      which enables us to sketch solutions to initial value problems.
      Our aim will be to understand the solutions qualitatively.
      That is, we would like to understand the basic nature of solutions,
      such as their long-range behavior,
      without precisely determining the value of a solution at a particular point.

      shows that we can sketch the solution to an initial value problem if we know an appropriate collection of tangent lines.
      We can use the differential equation to find the slope of the tangent line at any point of interest,
      and hence plot such a collection.

    <p permid="yFq">
      Let's continue looking at the differential equation <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2</m>.
      If <m>t=0</m>, this equation says that <m>dy/dt = 0-2=-2</m>.
      Note that this value holds regardless of the value of <m>y</m>.
      We will therefore sketch tangent lines for several values of <m>y</m> and <m>t=0</m> with a slope of <m>-2</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="F-7-2-field-0">Figure</xref>.

      Let's continue in the same way:
      if <m>t=1</m>,
      the differential equation tells us that <m>dy/dt = 1-2=-1</m>,
      and this holds regardless of the value of <m>y</m>.
      We now sketch tangent lines for several values of <m>y</m> and <m>t=1</m> with a slope of <m>-1</m> in 
      <xref ref="F-7-2-field-1">Figure</xref>.

      Similarly, we see that when <m>t=2</m>,
      <m>dy/dt = 0</m> and when <m>t=3</m>, <m>dy/dt=1</m>.
      We may therefore add to our growing collection of tangent line plots to achieve <xref ref="F-7-2-field-2">Figure</xref>.

      for the differential equation.
      It
      allows us to sketch solutions just as we did in the preview activity.
      We can begin with the initial value
      <m>y(0) = 1</m> and start sketching the solution by following the tangent line.
      Whenever the solution passes through a point at which a tangent line is drawn,
      that line is tangent to the solution.
      This principle leads us to the sequence of images in <xref ref="F-7-2-IVP-soln">Figure</xref>.

    <title>Equilibrium solutions and stability</title>
    <p permid="bRT">
      As our work in <xref ref="act-7-2-1">Activity</xref> demonstrates,
      first-order autonomous equations may have solutions that are constant.
      These are simple to detect by inspecting the differential equation <m>dy/dt = f(y)</m>:
      constant solutions necessarily have a zero derivative,
      so <m>dy/dt = 0 = f(y)</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="HZc">
      For example, in <xref ref="act-7-2-1">Activity</xref>,
      we considered the equation <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)=-\frac12(y-4)</m>.
      Constant solutions are found by setting <m>f(y) = -\frac12(y-4) = 0</m>,
      which we immediately see implies that <m>y = 4</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ogl">
      Values of <m>y</m> for which
      <m>f(y) = 0</m> in an autonomous differential equation
      <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)</m> are called 
      <em>equilibrium solutions</em>
