  <introduction>
    <p>In earlier work, we have used the tangent line to the graph of a
      function <m>f</m> at a point <m>a</m> to approximate the values of <m>f</m> near <m>a</m>.
      The usefulness of this approximation is that we need to know very
      little about the function; armed with only the value <m>f(a)</m> and the
      derivative <m>f'(a)</m>, we may find the equation of the tangent line and
      the approximation
      <me>
        f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Remember that a first-order differential equation gives us information
      about the derivative of an unknown function.
      Since the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the
      tangent line at this point, a differential equation
      gives us crucial information about the tangent lines to the graph of
      a solution. We will use this information about the tangent lines to
      create a <em>slope field</em> for the differential equation, which enables
      us to sketch solutions to initial value problems. Our aim will be to
      understand the solutions qualitatively. That is, we would like to
      understand the basic nature of solutions, such as their long-range
      behavior, without precisely determining the value of a solution at a
      particular point.</p>

    <title>Slope fields</title>
    <p><idx><h>slope field</h></idx></p>

    <p><xref ref="PA-7-2">Preview Activity</xref> shows that we may sketch the solution to an initial
      value problem if we know an appropriate collection of tangent lines. Because we may use a given differential equation to determine the slope of the tangent
      line at any point of interest, by plotting a useful collection of these, we can get an accurate sense of how certain solution curves must behave.</p>

    <p>Let's continue looking at the differential equation <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2.</m>
      If <m>t=0</m>, this equation says that <m>dy/dt = 0-2=-2</m>. Note that this value holds regardless of the value of <m>y</m>. We will therefore
      sketch tangent lines for several values of <m>y</m> and <m>t=0</m> with a slope
      of <m>-2</m>.</p>
   <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-0">
    <caption>Tangent lines at points with <m>t=0</m>.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="images/7_2_field_0" />
   </figure>
    <p>Let's continue in the same way: if <m>t=1</m>, the differential equation
      tells us that <m>dy/dt = 1-2=-1</m>, and this holds regardless of the value of <m>y</m>. We now sketch tangent lines for
      several values of <m>y</m> and <m>t=1</m> with a slope of <m>-1</m>.</p>
   <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-1">
       <caption>Adding tangent lines at points with <m>t=1</m>.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="images/7_2_field_1" />
   </figure>
    <p>Similarly, we see that when <m>t=2</m>, <m>dy/dt = 0</m> and when <m>t=3</m>,
      <m>dy/dt=1</m>. We may therefore add to our growing collection of tangent line plots to achieve the next figure.</p>
   <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-2">
       <caption>Adding tangent lines at points with <m>t=2</m> and <m>t=3</m>.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="images/7_2_field_3" />
   </figure>
    <p>In this figure, we begin to see the solutions to the differential
      equation emerge. However, for the sake of clarity, we
      add more tangent lines to provide the even more complete picture shown below.</p>
   <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-23">
    <caption>A completed slope field.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="images/7_2_field_23a" />
   </figure>
    <p>This most recent figure, which is called a <em>slope field</em><idx><h>slope field</h></idx> for the differential
      equation, allows us to sketch
      solutions just as we did in the preview activity. Here, we will begin with the
      initial value <m>y(0) = 1</m> and start sketching the solution by following
      the tangent line, as shown in the <xref ref="F-7-2-field-30">Figure</xref>.</p>
   <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-30">
       <caption>Beginning to sketch the solution function.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="images/7_2_field_30" />
   </figure>
    <p>We then continue using this principle: whenever the solution passes
      through a point at which a tangent line is drawn, that line is tangent
      to the solution. Doing so leads us to the following sequence of images.</p>
<sidebyside>     
   <!-- <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-31"> -->
    <image width="100%" source="images/7_2_field_31" />
   <!-- </figure>  -->
   <!-- <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-32"> -->
    <image width="100%" source="images/7_2_field_32" />
   <!-- </figure>  -->
</sidebyside> 
<sidebyside>  
   <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-33">
      <caption>The third image in a sequence that show how to sketch the IVP solution that satisfies <m>y(0)=1</m>.</caption> 
    <image width="100%" source="images/7_2_field_33" />
   </figure>
   <figure xml:id="F-7-2-field-4">
    <caption>Different solutions to <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2</m> that correspond to different initial values.</caption>
    <image width="100%" source="images/7_2_field_4" />
   </figure>
</sidebyside>   

    <p>In fact, we may draw solutions for any possible initial value, and doing this for several different initial values for <m>y(0)</m> results in the graphs shown at bottom right in <xref ref="F-7-2-field-4">Figure</xref>.</p>
    <p>Just as we have done for the most recent example with <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2</m>, we can construct a slope field for any differential equation of interest. The slope field provides us with visual information about how we expect solutions to the differential equation to behave.</p>

    <title>Equilibrium solutions and stability</title>
    <p>As our work in <xref ref="act-7-2-1">Activity</xref> demonstrates, first-order autonomous
      solutions may have solutions that are constant. In fact, these are
      quite easy to detect by inspecting the differential equation <m>dy/dt =
      f(y)</m>: constant solutions necessarily have a zero derivative so
      <m>dy/dt = 0 = f(y)</m>.</p>

    <p>For example, in <xref ref="act-7-2-1">Activity</xref>, we considered the
      equation
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)=-\frac12(y-4).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Constant solutions are found by setting <m>f(y) = -\frac12(y-4) = 0</m>,
      which we immediately see implies that <m>y = 4</m>.</p>

    <p>Values of <m>y</m> for which <m>f(y) = 0</m> in an autonomous differential equation <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)</m> are usually called or <em>equilibrium solutions</em> <idx><h>equilibrium solution</h></idx> of the differential
      equation.</p>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <p><ul>
      <li><p>A slope field is a plot created by graphing the tangent lines of
            many different solutions to a differential equation.</p></li>

      <li><p>Once we have a slope field, we may sketch the graph of solutions
            by drawing a curve that is always tangent to the lines in the slope
            field.</p></li>

      <li><p>Autonomous differential equations sometimes have constant
            solutions that we call
            equilibrium solutions.  These may be classified as stable or
            unstable, depending on the behavior of nearby solutions.</p></li>
