  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec-7-2-qualitative">Section</xref>,
      we saw how a slope field can be used to sketch solutions to a differential equation.
      In particular,
      the slope field is a plot of a large collection of tangent lines to a large number of solutions of the differential equation,
      and we sketch a single solution by simply following these tangent lines.
      With a little more thought,
      we can use this same idea to approximate numerically the solutions of a differential equation.

    <title>Euler's Method</title>

      <xref ref="PA-7-3">Preview Activity</xref>
      demonstrates an algorithm known as Euler's<fn><q>Euler</q> is pronounced <q>Oy-ler.</q>
      Among other things, Euler is the mathematician credited with the famous number <m>e</m>;
      if you incorrectly pronounce his name <q>You-ler,</q>
      you fail to appreciate his genius and legacy.</fn>Method, which generates a numerical approximation to the solution of an initial value problem.
      In this algorithm,
      we will approximate the solution by taking horizontal steps of a fixed size that we denote by <m>\Delta t</m>.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
      <stack>
        <p>
          Before explaining the algorithm in detail,
          let's remember how we compute the slope of a line:
          the slope is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change,
          as shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-slope">Figure</xref>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In other words, <m>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}</m>.
          Solving for <m>\Delta y</m>, we see that the
          vertical change is the product of the slope and the horizontal change, or
          <me>
            \Delta y = m\Delta t
          </me>.
        </p>
      </stack>
      <figure xml:id="F-7-3-slope">
        <caption>The role of slope in Euler's Method.</caption>
        <image source="images/7_3_slope" />
      </figure>
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      Now, suppose that we would like to solve the initial value problem
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = t - y, \ y(0) = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is an algorithm by which we can find an algebraic formula for the solution to this initial value problem,
      and we can check that this solution is <m>y(t) = t -1 + 2e^{-t}</m>.  But
      we are instead interested in generating an approximate solution by creating a sequence of points <m>(t_i, y_i)</m>,
      where <m>y_i\approx y(t_i)</m>.
      For this first example, we choose <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we know that <m>y(0) = 1</m>,
      we will take the initial point to be
      <m>(t_0,y_0) = (0,1)</m> and move horizontally by <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m> to the
      point <m>(t_1,y_1)</m>.
      Thus, <m>t_1=t_0+\Delta t = 0.2</m>.
      Now, the differential equation tells us that the slope of the
      tangent line at this point is
      <me>
        m=\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg\vert_{(0,1)} = 0-1 = -1
      </me>,
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 44%" margins="0%">
      <p>
        so to move along the tangent line by taking a horizontal step of size <m>\Delta t=0.2</m>,
        we must also move vertically by
        <me>
          \Delta y = m\Delta t = -1\cdot 0.2 = -0.2
        </me>.
        We then have the approximation <m>y(0.2) \approx y_1= y_0 + \Delta y = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8</m>.
        At this point, we have executed one step of Euler's method,
        as seen graphically in <xref ref="F-7-3-euler-points-1">Figure</xref>.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="F-7-3-euler-points-1">
        <caption>One step of Euler's method.</caption>
        <image source="images/7_3_euler_points_1" />
      </figure>
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      Now we repeat this process:
      at <m>(t_1,y_1) = (0.2,0.8)</m>, the
      differential equation tells us that the slope is
      <me>
        m=\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg\vert_{(0.2,0.8)} = 0.2-0.8 = -0.6
      </me>.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 44%" margins="0%">
      <p>
        If we move forward horizontally by
        <m>\Delta t</m> to <m>t_2=t_1+\Delta = 0.4</m>,
        we must move vertically by
        <me>
          \Delta y = -0.6\cdot0.2 = -0.12
        </me>.
        We consequently arrive at <m>y_2=y_1+\Delta y = 0.8-0.12 = 0.68</m>,
        which gives <m>y(0.2)\approx 0.68</m>.
        Now we have completed the second step of Euler's method,
        as shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-euler-points-2">Figure</xref>.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="F-7-3-euler-points-2">

        <image source="images/7_3_euler_points_2" />
      </figure>
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      If we continue in this way,
      we may generate the points
      <m>(t_i, y_i)</m> shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-Euler-Pts-a">Figure</xref>.
      Because we can find a formula for the actual solution <m>y(t)</m> to this differential equation,
      we can graph <m>y(t)</m> and compare it to the points generated by Euler's method,
      as shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-Euler-Pts-b">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      Because we need to generate a large number of points <m>(t_i,y_i)</m>,
      it is convenient to organize the implementation of Euler's method in a table as shown.
      We begin with the given initial data.

    <title>The error in Euler's method</title>
    <idx><h>Euler's Method</h><h>error</h></idx>

    <p>
      Since we are approximating the solutions to an initial value problem
      using tangent lines, we should expect that the error in the
      approximation will be smaller when the step size is smaller.
      Consider the initial value problem
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = y, \ y(0) = 1,
      </me>
      whose solution we can easily find.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question posed by this initial value problem is
      <q>what function do we know that is the same as its own derivative and has value 1 when <m>t=0</m>?</q>
      It is not hard to see that the solution is <m>y(t) = e^t</m>.
      We now apply Euler's method to approximate
      <m>y(1) = e</m> using several values of <m>\Delta t</m>.
      These approximations will be denoted by <m>E_{\Delta t}</m>,
      and we'll use them to see how accurate Euler's Method is.
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin, we apply Euler's method with a step size of <m>\Delta t =
      0.2</m>.
      In that case, we find that <m>y(1) \approx E_{0.2} = 2.4883</m>.
      The
      error is therefore
      <me>
        y(1) - E_{0.2} = e - 2.4883 \approx 0.2300
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Repeatedly halving <m>\Delta t</m> gives the following results,
      expressed in both tabular and graphical form.
    </p>

    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      Notice, both numerically and graphically,
      that the error is roughly halved when <m>\Delta t</m> is halved.
      This example illustrates the following general principle.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Euler's method is used to approximate the solution to an initial
      value problem at a point <m>\overline{t}</m>, then the error is
      proportional to <m>\Delta t</m>.
      That is,
      <me>
        y(\overline{t}) - E_{\Delta t} \approx K\Delta t
      </me>
      for some constant of proportionality <m>K</m>.

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Euler's method is an algorithm for approximating the solution to an initial value problem by following the tangent lines while we take horizontal steps across the <m>t</m>-axis.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If we wish to approximate <m>y(\overline{t})</m> for some fixed
            <m>\overline{t}</m> by taking horizontal steps of size <m>\Delta t</m>,
            then the error in our approximation is proportional to <m>\Delta t</m>.
