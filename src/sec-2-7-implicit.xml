  <introduction permid="VFV">
    <p permid="FrE">
      In all of our studies with derivatives so far,
      we have worked with functions whose formula is given explicitly in terms of <m>x</m>.
      But there are many interesting curves whose equations involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are impossible to solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-7-Intro" permid="Kbx">
      <caption>At left, the circle given by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.  In the middle, the portion of the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> that has been highlighted in the box at left.  And at right, the lemniscate given by <m>x^3 - y^3 = 6xy</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/2_7_Intro" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="lyN">
      Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles.
      Because of the circle's symmetry,
      for each <m>x</m> value strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter,
      there are two corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
      For instance, in <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>,
      we have labeled <m>A = (-3,\sqrt{7})</m> and <m>B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})</m>,
      and these points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test.
      Hence, it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      But
      portions of the circle can be represented explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>,
      such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>.
      Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear,
      so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point.
      Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> at any point on the circle,
      even though we cannot write <m>y</m> explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="RFW">
      We say that the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> defines <m>y</m> <em>implicitly</em>
      as a function of <m>x</m>.
      The graph of the equation can be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of <m>x</m>.
      For the circle,
      we could choose to take the top half as one function of <m>x</m>,
      namely <m>y = \sqrt{16 - x^2}</m> and the bottom half as <m>y = -\sqrt{16 - x^2}</m>.
      The equation for the circle defines two
      <em> implicit functions</em> of <m>x</m>.

      The righthand curve in <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>
      is called a <em>lemniscate</em>
          <idx><h>lemniscate</h></idx>
      and is just one of many fascinating possibilities for implicitly given curves.

      How can we find an equation for
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> without an explicit formula for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>?

    <title>Implicit Differentiation</title>
    <p permid="qiG">
      We begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle given by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.
      How can we find a formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>?
    </p>

    <p permid="WpP">
      By viewing <m>y</m> as an <em>implicit</em>
      function of <m>x</m>,
      we think of <m>y</m> as some function whose formula <m>f(x)</m> is unknown,
      but which we can differentiate.
      Just as <m>y</m> represents an unknown formula,
      so too its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>,
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, will be
      (at least temporarily)
      unknown.
    </p>

    <p permid="CwY">
      So we view <m>y</m> as an unknown differentiable function of <m>x</m> and
      differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>.
      <me permid="Yfc">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 + y^2 \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 16 \right]
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iEh">
      On the right,
      the derivative of the constant <m>16</m> is <m>0</m>,
      and on the left we can apply the sum rule,
      so it follows that
      <me permid="Eml">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 \right]  + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ y^2 \right] = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OLq">
      Note carefully the different roles being played by <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is the independent variable,
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[x^2\right] = 2x</m>.
      But <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>.
      Recall <xref ref="PA-2-7">Preview Activity</xref>,
      where we computed <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)^2]</m>.
      Computing <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]</m> is the same,
      and requires the chain rule, 
      by which we find that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y^1 \frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We now have that
      <me permid="ktu">
        2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="uSz">
      We solve this equation for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by
      subtracting <m>2x</m> from both sides and dividing by <m>2y</m>.
      <me permid="QAD">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{2y} = -\frac{x}{y}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="aZI">
      There are several important things to observe about the result that <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.
      First, this expression for the derivative involves both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      This makes sense because 
      there are two corresponding points on the circle for each value of <m>x</m> between <m>-4</m> and <m>4</m>,
      and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 46%" margins="0%" valign="middle" permid="JrD">
      <p permid="tdm">
        Second, this formula is entirely consistent with our understanding of circles.
        The slope of the radius from the origin to the point <m>(a,b)</m> is <m>m_r = \frac{b}{a}</m>.
        The tangent line to the circle at <m>(a,b)</m> is perpendicular to the radius,
        and thus has slope <m>m_t = -\frac{a}{b}</m>,
        as shown in <xref ref="F-2-7-Circle">Figure</xref>.
        In particular,
        the slope of the tangent line is zero at <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(0,-4)</m>,
        and is undefined at <m>(-4,0)</m> and <m>(4,0)</m>.
        All of these values are consistent with the formula <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.

        <p permid="PQJ">
          We begin by differentiating the curve's equation implicitly.
          Taking the derivative of each side with respect to <m>x</m>,

          by the sum rule and the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we have

          For the three derivatives we now must execute,
          the first uses the simple power rule,
          the second requires the chain rule
          (since <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>),
          and the third necessitates the product rule
          (again since <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>).
          Applying these rules, we now find that

        <p permid="cfb">
          We want to solve this equation for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
          To do so, we first collect all of the terms involving

          <me permid="pdn">
            2y\frac{dy}{dx} - 2x \frac{dy}{dx}= 2y - 3x^2

        <p permid="Imk">
          Then we factor the left side to isolate <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
          <me permid="Vkw">
            \frac{dy}{dx}(2y - 2x) = 2y - 3x^2
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="ott">
          Finally, we divide both sides by <m>(2y - 2x)</m> and conclude that
          <me permid="BrF">
            \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2y-3x^2}{2y-2x}
          </me>.

        <p permid="UAC">
          Note that the expression for

          To find the slope of the tangent line at <m>(-1,1)</m>,
          we substitute the coordinates into the formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,

    <p permid="HgR">
      <xref ref="Ex-2-7-1">Example</xref>

      On the other hand,
      <me permid="ZUp">
        \frac{dy}{dx}(x^2 + y^2)

      means the product of the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> with the quantity <m>x^2 + y^2</m>.
      Understanding this notational subtlety is essential.

    <p permid="zCs">
      It is natural to ask where the tangent line to a curve is vertical or horizontal.
      The slope of a horizontal tangent line must be zero,
      while the slope of a vertical tangent line is undefined.
      Often the formula for
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is expressed as a quotient of functions of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, say
      <me permid="Gby">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="fJB">
      The tangent line is horizontal precisely when the numerator is zero and the denominator is nonzero,
      making the slope of the tangent line zero.
      If we can solve the equation
      <m>p(x,y) = 0</m> for either <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of the other,
      we can substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve.
      This gives an equation in a single variable,
      and if we can solve that equation we can find the point(s) on the curve where <m>p(x,y) = 0</m>.
      At those points, the tangent line is horizontal.
    </p>

    <p permid="LQK">
      Similarly, the tangent line is vertical whenever
      <m>q(x,y) = 0</m> and <m>p(x,y) \ne 0</m>,
      making the slope undefined.
