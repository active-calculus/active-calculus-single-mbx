      We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing,
      and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down.
      This information helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph,
      as well as whether the function has relative extrema.
    </p>

    <p permid="zok">
      Remember the difference between a relative maximum and a global maximum:
      there is a <em>relative</em> maximum of <m>f</m> at <m>x = p</m> if
      <m>f(p) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> <em>near</em> <m>p</m>,
      while there is a <em>global</em> maximum at <m>p</m> if
      <m>f(p) \ge f(x)</m> for <em>all</em>
      <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.

    <sidebyside widths="50% 44%" margins="0%" permid="sfk">
      <p permid="GSJ">
        For instance, in <xref ref="F-3-3-Intro">Figure</xref>,
        we see a function <m>f</m> that has a global maximum at <m>x = c</m> and a relative maximum at <m>x = a</m>,
        since <m>f(c)</m> is greater than <m>f(x)</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
        while <m>f(a)</m> is only greater than the value of <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>.
        Since the function appears to decrease without bound,
        <m>f</m> has no global minimum,
        though clearly <m>f</m> has a relative minimum at <m>x = b</m>.

    <title>Global Optimization</title>
    <p permid="LCC">
      In <xref ref="F-3-3-Intro">Figure</xref>
      and <xref ref="PA-3-3">Preview Activity</xref>,
      we were interested in finding the global minimum and global maximum for <m>f</m> on its entire domain.
      At other times, we might focus on some restriction of the domain.
    </p>

    <p permid="rJL">
      For example, rather than considering
      <m>f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
      perhaps instead we are only interested in those <m>x</m> for which <m>0 \le x \le 4</m>,
      and we would like to know which values of <m>x</m> in the interval <m>[0,4]</m> produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of <m>f</m>.
      We are accustomed to critical numbers playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function;
      now, by restricting the domain to an interval,
      it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider,
      as we see in the following activity.
      When limiting ourselves to a particular interval,
      we will often refer to the <em>absolute</em>
      maximum or minimum value,
      rather than the <em>global</em> maximum or minimum.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-3-3-1.xml" />

    <p permid="XQU">
      In <xref ref="act-3-3-1">Activity</xref>,
      we saw how the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed,
      bounded interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      depend not only on the critical numbers of the function,
      but also on the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      These observations demonstrate several important facts that hold more generally.
      First, we state an important result called the Extreme Value Theorem.
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="extreme-value-theorem" permid="zJJ">
      <title>The Extreme Value Theorem</title>
      <p permid="DYd">
            <idx><h>extreme value theorem</h></idx>
        If <m>f</m> is a continuous function on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
        then <m>f</m> attains both an absolute minimum and absolute maximum on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        That is, for some value <m>x_m</m> such that <m>a \le x_m \le b</m>,
        it follows that <m>f(x_m) \le f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
        Similarly, there is a value <m>x_M</m> in <m>[a,b]</m> such that
        <m>f(x_M) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
        Letting <m>m = f(x_m)</m> and <m>M = f(x_M)</m>,
        it follows that <m>m \le f(x) \le M</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="kfm">
      The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that 
      on any closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      a continuous function has to achieve both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum.
      The theorem does not tell us where these extreme values occur,
      but rather only that they must exist.
      As we saw in <xref ref="act-3-3-1">Activity</xref>,
      the only possible locations for relative extremes are at the endpoints of the interval or at a critical number.
    </p>

    <note permid="kAL">
      <p permid="uEr">
        Thus, we have the following approach to finding the absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>:

          <li permid="tUx">
            <p permid="HYc">
              evaluate the function <m>f</m> at each critical number in the interval and at each endpoint of the interval;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="abG">
            <p permid="ofl">
              from among those function values,
              the smallest is the absolute minimum of <m>f</m> on the interval,
              while the largest is the absolute maximum.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </note>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-3-3-2.xml" />

    <p permid="Qmv">
      The interval we choose has nearly the same influence on extreme values as the function under consideration.
      Consider, for instance,
      the function pictured in <xref ref="F-3-3-Interval">Figure</xref>.

      In sequence, from left to right,

        <li permid="GiP">

    <p permid="oPf">
      We conclude this section with an example of an applied optimization problem.
      It highlights the role that a closed,
      bounded domain can play in finding absolute extrema.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-3-3-1" permid="fQS">
      <statement>
        <p permid="aLA">
          A 20 cm piece of wire is cut into two pieces.
          One piece is used to form a square and the other to form an equilateral triangle.
          How should the wire be cut to maximize the total area enclosed by the square and triangle? to minimize the area?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="EtC">
        <p permid="Fdw">
          We begin by sketching a picture that illustrates the situation.
          The variable in the problem is where we decide to cut the wire.
          We thus label the cut point at a distance <m>x</m> from one end of the wire,
          and note that the remaining portion of the wire then has length <m>20-x</m>
        </p>
        <!--<sidebyside widths="39% 56%" margins="0%">-->
        <p permid="lkF">
          As shown in <xref ref="F-3-3-Ex1">Figure</xref>,
          we see that the <m>x</m> cm of wire that is used to form the equilateral triangle with three sides of length <m>\frac{x}{3}</m>.
          For the remaining <m>20-x</m> cm of wire,
          the square that results will have each side of length <m>\frac{20-x}{4}</m>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="F-3-3-Ex1" permid="ipZ">

      <!--</sidebyside>-->
        <p permid="RrO">
          At this point,
          we note that there are obvious restrictions on <m>x</m>:
          in particular, <m>0 \le x \le 20</m>.
          In the extreme cases,
          all of the wire is being used to make just one figure.
          For instance, if <m>x = 0</m>,
          then all 20 cm of wire are used to make a square that is <m>5 \times 5</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="xyX">
          Now, our overall goal is to find the minimum and maximum areas that can be enclosed.
          Because the height of an equilateral triangle is
          <m>\sqrt{3}</m> times half the length of the base,
          the area of the triangle is

          </me>.
          The area of the square is <m>A_{\Box} = s^2 = \left( \frac{20-x}{4} \right)^2</m>.
          Therefore, the total area function is
          <me permid="NrP">
            A(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}x^2}{36} + \left( \frac{20-x}{4} \right)^2

        <p permid="dGg">
          Remember that we are considering this function only on the restricted domain <m>[0,20]</m>.

        <p permid="JNp">
          Differentiating <m>A(x)</m>, we have

            A'(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}x}{18} + 2\left( \frac{20-x}{4} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{18} x + \frac{1}{8}x - \frac{5}{2}

        <p permid="pUy">
          When we set <m>A'(x) = 0</m>,
          we find that <m>x = \frac{180}{4\sqrt{3}+9} \approx 11.3007</m> is the only critical number of <m>A</m> in the interval <m>[0,20]</m>.

          The absolute maximum occurs when we invest all of the wire in the square
