    <title>The sine and cosine functions</title>
    <p permid="jJn">
      The sine and cosine functions are among the most important functions in all of mathematics.
      Sometimes called the <em>circular</em>
      functions due to their definition on the unit circle,
      these periodic functions play a key role in modeling repeating phenomena such as tidal elevations,
      the behavior of an oscillating mass attached to a spring,
      or the location of a point on a bicycle tire.
      Like polynomial and exponential functions,
      the sine and cosine functions are considered basic functions,
      ones that are often used in building more complicated functions.
      As such, we would like to know formulas for
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)]</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)]</m>,
      and the next two activities lead us to that end.

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-2-2-2.xml" />

    <p permid="PQw">
      The results of the two preceding activities suggest that the sine and cosine functions not only have beautiful connections such as the identities <m>\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1</m> and
      <m>\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(x)</m>,
      but that they are even further linked through calculus,
      as the derivative of each involves the other.
      The following rules summarize the results of the activities<fn>
      These two rules may be formally proved using the limit definition of the derivative and the expansion identities for
      <m>\sin(x+h)</m> and <m>\cos(x+h)</m>.
      </fn>.

      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="ceO">
      We have now added the sine and cosine functions to our library of basic functions whose derivatives we know.
      The constant multiple and sum rules still hold, of course,
      as well as all of the inherent meaning of the derivative.

            For an exponential function <m>f(x) = a^x</m> <m>(a \gt 1)</m>,
            the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> appears to be a scaled version of the original function.
            In particular, careful analysis of the graph of<m>f(x) = 2^x</m>,
            suggests that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[2^x] = 2^x \ln(2)</m>,
            which is a special case of the rule we stated in <xref ref="sec-2-1-elem-rules">Section</xref>.

            <m>y = \sin(x)</m> and <m>y = \cos(x)</m>,
            and by using the limit definition of the derivative at select points,
            we found that <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)] = \cos(x)</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)</m>.

            We note that all previously encountered derivative rules still hold,
            but now may also be applied to functions involving the sine and cosine.
            All of the established meaning of the derivative applies to these trigonometric functions as well.
