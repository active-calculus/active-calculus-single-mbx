      Any moving object has a <em>position</em>
          <idx><h>position</h></idx>
      that can be considered a function of <em>time</em>.
      When the motion is along a straight line,
      the position is given by a single variable,
      which we denote by <m>s(t)</m>.
      For example,
      <m>s(t)</m> might give the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time <m>t</m> in hours.
      Similarly, the function <m>s</m> described in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Preview Activity</xref> is a position function,
      where position is measured vertically relative to the ground.

    <p permid="vuC">
      On any time interval, a moving object also has an
      <em>average velocity</em>.
      For example,
      to compute a car's average velocity we divide the number of miles traveled by the time elapsed,
      which gives the velocity in <em>miles per hour</em>.
      Similarly, the value of <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m> in <xref ref="PA-1-1">Preview Activity</xref>

    <title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
    <p permid="TXm">
      Whether we are driving a car,
      riding a bike, or throwing a ball,
      we have an intuitive sense that a moving object has a velocity at any given moment -- a number that measures how fast the object is moving <em>right now</em>.
      For instance,
      a car's speedometer tells the driver the car's velocity at any given instant.
      In fact, the velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval.
      If we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter,
      we can progress from average velocity to
      <em>instantaneous</em> velocity.
    </p>

    <p permid="Aev">
      Informally, we define the <em>instantaneous velocity</em>
          <idx><h>instantaneous velocity</h></idx>
      of a moving object at time <m>t = a</m> to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing <m>t = a</m>.
      We will develop a more formal definition of instantaneous velocity soon,
      and this definition will be the foundation of much of our work in calculus.
      For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity as follows:
      take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals around a specific point.
      If those average velocities approach a single number,
      then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.

      <!-- As we saw in in <xref ref="act-1-1-1">Activity</xref>,
      it follows that ...
      (will cross-referencing work for activities?)
      -->
      At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
      Each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function.
      We are interested in computing average velocities on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> for smaller and smaller intervals.
      In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal,
      think of the value <m>b</m> as <m>b = a + h</m>,
      where <m>h</m> is a small (non-zero) number that is allowed to vary.
      Then the average velocity of the object on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> is
      <me permid="EOo">
        AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
      </me>,
      with the denominator being simply <m>h</m> because <m>(a+h) - a = h</m>.
      Note that when <m>h \lt  0</m>,
      <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> measures the average velocity on the interval <m>[a+h,a]</m>.

    <p permid="MsN">
      To find the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = a</m>,
      we investigate what happens as the value of <m>h</m> approaches zero.

              and because the function only makes sense on the time interval <m>0 \le t \le 1</m>,
              as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling.
              We want to compute and simplify

              We start by finding <m>s(0.5+h)</m>.
              To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function <m>s</m>.

              </md>.
              Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity,
              we find that
              <md permid="Jyh">
                <mrow>AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} \amp  =  \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  =  \frac{(12 - 16h - 16h^2) - (16 - 16(0.5)^2)}{0.5 + h - 0.5}</mrow>

                <mrow>\amp  =  \frac{-16h - 16h^2}{h}</mrow>
              </md>.
              At this point, we note two things:
              first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on <m>h</m>,
              which it must,
              since as <m>h</m> changes the average velocity will change.
              Further, we note that since <m>h</m> can never equal zero,
              we may remove the common factor of <m>h</m> from the numerator and denominator.
              It follows that
              <me permid="RcG">
                AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = -16 - 16h
              </me>.
            </li>

            <li permid="tFp">
              From this expression we can compute the average for any small positive or negative value of <m>h</m>.
              For instance, to obtain the average velocity on
              <m>[0.5,0.75]</m>, we let <m>h = 0.25</m>,
              and the average velocity is <m>-16 - 16(0.25) = -20</m> ft/sec.
              To get the average velocity on <m>[0.4, 0.5]</m>,
              we let <m>h = -0.1</m>, and compute the average velocity as
              <me permid="xjP">
                -16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4\ \text{ft/sec}

            </li>

            <li permid="ZMy">
              We can even explore what happens to
              <m>AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}</m> as <m>h</m> gets closer and closer to zero.
              As <m>h</m> approaches zero,
              <m>-16h</m> will also approach zero,
              so it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <m>t = 0.5</m> should be <m>-16</m> ft/sec.

            We begin with a familiar problem:
            a ball being tossed straight up in the air from an initial height.
            From this elementary scenario,
            we will ask questions about how the ball is moving.
            These questions will lead us to begin investigating ideas that will be central throughout our study of differential calculus and that have wide-ranging consequences.
            In a great deal of our thinking about calculus,
            we will be well-served by remembering this first example and asking ourselves how the various
            (sometimes abstract)
            ideas we are considering are related to the simple act of tossing a ball straight up in the air.

        <title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
        <p>
            Whether driving a car, riding a bike, or throwing a ball,
            we have an intuitive sense that any moving object has a velocity at any given moment -- a number that measures how fast the object is moving <em>right now</em>.
            For instance,
            a car's speedometer tells the driver what appears to be the car's velocity at any given instant.
            In fact, the posted velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval
            (by computing how many revolutions the tires have undergone to compute distance traveled),
            since velocity fundamentally comes from considering a change in position divided by a change in time.
            But if we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter,
            then we can progress from average velocity to
            <em>instantaneous</em> velocity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Informally, we define the <em>instantaneous velocity</em>
            <idx><h>instantaneous velocity</h></idx>
            of a moving object at time <m>t = a</m> to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing <m>t = a</m> to compute the average velocity.
            We will develop a more formal definition of this momentarily,
            one that will end up being the foundation of much of our work in first semester calculus.
            For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity this way:
            take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals,
            and if those average velocities approach a single number,
            then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.
        </p>

        <xi:include href="./activities/act-1-1-2.xml" />

        <p>
            At this point we have started to see a close connection between average velocity and instantaneous velocity,
            as well as how each is connected not only to the physical behavior of the moving object but also to the geometric behavior of the graph of the position function.
            In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal,
            we will introduce the notion of <em>limit</em>
            in <xref ref="sec-1-2-lim">Section</xref>.
            As a preview of that concept,
            we look at a way to consider the limiting value of average velocity through the introduction of a parameter.
            Note that if we desire to know the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = a</m> of a moving object with position function <m>s</m>,
            we are interested in computing average velocities on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> for smaller and smaller intervals.
            One way to visualize this is to think of the value <m>b</m> as being <m>b = a + h</m>,
            where <m>h</m> is a small number that is allowed to vary.
            Thus, we observe that the average velocity of the object on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> is
            <me>
                AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}
                </me>,
                with the denominator being simply <m>h</m> because <m>(a+h) - a = h</m>.
                Initially, it is fine to think of <m>h</m> being a small positive real number;
                but it is important to note that we allow <m>h</m> to be a small negative number, too,
                as this enables us to investigate the average velocity of the moving object on intervals prior to <m>t = a</m>,
                as well as following <m>t = a</m>.
                When <m>h \lt  0</m>,
                <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> measures the average velocity on the interval <m>[a+h,a]</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To attempt to find the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = a</m>,
            we investigate what happens as the value of <m>h</m> approaches zero.
            We consider this further in the following example.

                    For a falling ball whose position function is given by <m>s(t) = 16 - 16t^2</m>
                    (where <m>s</m> is measured in feet and <m>t</m> in seconds),
                    find an expression for the average velocity of the ball on a time interval of the form
                    <m>[0.5, 0.5+h]</m> where <m>-0.5 \lt h \lt 0.5</m> and <m>h \ne 0</m>.
                    Use this expression to compute the average velocity on
                    <m>[0.5,0.75]</m> and <m>[0.4,0.5]</m>,
                    as well as to make a conjecture about the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 0.5</m>.

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We make the assumptions that
                    <m>-0.5 \lt  h \lt  0.5</m> and <m>h \ne 0</m> because <m>h</m> cannot be zero
                    (otherwise there is no interval on which to compute average velocity)
                    and because the function only makes sense on the time interval <m>0 \le t \le 1</m>,
                    as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling.
                    Observe that we want to compute and simplify
                    <me>
                        AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}
                        </me>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most unusual part of this computation is finding <m>s(0.5+h)</m>.
                    To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function <m>s</m>.
                    In particular, since <m>s(t) = 16-16t^2</m>, we see that
                    <md>
                        <mrow>s(0.5+h) \amp  =  16 - 16(0.5 + h)^2</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp  =  16 - 16(0.25 + h + h^2)</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp  =  16 - 4 - 16h - 16h^2</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp  =  12 - 16h - 16h^2</mrow>
                        </md>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity,
                    we find that
                    <md>
                        <mrow>AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} \amp  =  \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp  =  \frac{(12 - 16h - 16h^2) - (16 - 16(0.5)^2)}{0.5 + h - 0.5}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp  =  \frac{12 - 16h - 16h^2 - 12}{h}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp  =  \frac{-16h - 16h^2}{h}</mrow>
                        </md>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point, we note two things:
                    first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on <m>h</m>,
                    which it must,
                    since as <m>h</m> changes the average velocity will change.
                    Further, we note that since <m>h</m> can never equal zero,
                    we may further simplify the most recent expression.
                    Removing the common factor of <m>h</m> from the numerator and denominator,
                    it follows that
                    <me>
                        AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = -16 - 16h
                        </me>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, for any small positive or negative value of <m>h</m>,
                    we can compute the average velocity.
                    For instance, to obtain the average velocity on
                    <m>[0.5,0.75]</m>, we let <m>h = 0.25</m>,
                    and the average velocity is <m>-16 - 16(0.25) = -20</m> ft/sec.
                    To get the average velocity on
                    <m>[0.4, 0.5]</m>, we let <m>h = -0.1</m>,
                    which tells us the average velocity is <m>-16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4</m> ft/sec.
                    Moreover, we can even explore what happens to
                    <m>AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}</m> as <m>h</m> gets closer and closer to zero.
                    As <m>h</m> approaches zero,
                    <m>-16h</m> will also approach zero,
                    and thus it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <m>t = 0.5</m> should be <m>-16</m> ft/sec.
