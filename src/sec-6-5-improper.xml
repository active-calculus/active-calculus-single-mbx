  <introduction permid="VzR">
    <p permid="jDw">
      Another important application of the definite integral
      measures the likelihood of certain events.
      For instance,
      consider a company that manufactures incandescent light bulbs.
      Based on a large volume of test results,
      they have determined that the fraction of light bulbs that fail between times <m>t = a</m> and <m>t = b</m> of use
      (where <m>t</m> is measured in months)
      is given by
      <me permid="WjL">
        \int_a^b 0.3 e^{-0.3t} \, dt
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="PKF">
      For example,
      the fraction of light bulbs that fail during their third month of use is given by
      <md permid="CqU">
        <mrow>\int_2^3 0.3e^{-0.3t} \, dt \amp = -e^{-0.3t} \bigg \vert_2^3</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = -e^{-0.9} + e^{-0.6}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \approx  0.1422</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="vRO">
      Thus about 14.22<percent /> of all lightbulbs fail between <m>t = 2</m> and <m>t = 3</m>.
      Clearly we could adjust the limits of integration to measure the fraction of light bulbs that fail during any time period of interest.

    <title>Improper Integrals Involving Unbounded Intervals</title>
    <idx><h>improper integral</h></idx>

    <p permid="bYX">
      In view of the above examples, 
      we see that we may want to integrate over an interval whose upper limit grows without bound.
      For example,
      to find the fraction of light bulbs that fail <em>eventually</em>,
      we wish to find
      <me permid="iyd">
        \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b 0.3e^{-0.3t} \, dt
      </me>,
      for which we will also use the notation
      <men xml:id="E-ImpInt1" permid="OFm">
        \int_0^\infty 0.3e^{-0.3t} \, dt
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Igg">
      Such an integral can be interpreted as the area of an unbounded region,
      as pictured at right in <xref ref="F-6-5-InfReg">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-6-5-InfReg" permid="ABH">

    <p permid="onp">
      We call an integral for which the interval of integration is unbounded <em>improper</em>.
          <idx><h>improper integral</h><h>unbounded region of integration</h></idx>
      For instance, the integrals
      <me permid="uMv">
        \int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx, \ \ \int_{-\infty}^0 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx, \ \ \text{and}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx
      </me>
      are all improper because they have limits of integration that involve <m>\infty</m>.
      To evaluate an improper integral we replace it with a limit of proper integrals.
      That is,
      <me permid="aTE">
        \int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b f(x) \,dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Uuy">
      We first attempt to evaluate
      <m>\int_0^b f(x) \,dx</m> using the First FTC, and then evaluate the limit.
      Is it even possible for the area of an unbounded region to be finite?
      The following activity explores this issue and others in more detail.

    <title>Convergence and Divergence</title>

      suggests that <m>\lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b f(x) \, dx</m> is either finite or infinite
      (or it doesn't exist).
      With these possibilities in mind,
      we introduce the following terminology.

    <title>Improper Integrals Involving Unbounded Integrands</title>
    <p permid="Zer">
      An integral is also called improper if the integrand is unbounded on the interval of integration.
      For example, consider
      <me permid="nhW">
        \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx
      </me>.
      Because <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 0</m>,
      <m>f</m> is not continuous on <m>[0,1]</m>,
      and the integral represents the area of the unbounded region shown at right in <xref ref="F-6-5-InfIntegrand">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-6-5-InfIntegrand" permid="dOk">
      <caption>At left, the area bounded by <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</m> on the finite interval <m>[a,1]</m>; at right, the result of letting <m>a \to 0^+</m>, where we see that the shaded region will extend vertically without bound.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="images/6_5_InfIntegrand" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="FlA">
      We address the problem of the integrand being unbounded
          <idx><h>improper integral</h><h>unbounded integrand</h></idx>
      by replacing the improper integral with a limit of proper integrals.
      For example,
      to evaluate <m>\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx</m>,
      we replace <m>0</m> with <m>a</m> and let <m>a</m> approach 0 from the right.
      Thus,
      <me permid="Tpf">
        \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx = \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx
      </me>.
      We evaluate the proper integral <m>\int_a^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx</m>,
      and then take the limit.
      We will say that the improper integral converges if this limit exists,
      and diverges otherwise.
      In this example, we observe that
      <md permid="zwo">
        <mrow>\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx &amp;=  \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= \lim_{a \to 0^+} 2\sqrt{x} \big\vert_a^1</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= \lim_{a \to 0^+} 2\sqrt{1} - 2\sqrt{a}</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= 2</mrow>
      </md>,
      so the improper integral
      <m>\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx</m> converges
      (to the value 2).
    </p>

    <p permid="lsJ">
      We have to be particularly careful with unbounded integrands,
      for they may arise in ways that may not initially be obvious.
      Consider, for instance, the integral
      <me permid="fDx">
        \int_1^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="RzS">
      At first glance we might think that we can simply apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by antidifferentiating <m>\frac{1}{(x-2)^2}</m> to get
      <m>-\frac{1}{x-2}</m> and then evaluating from <m>1</m> to <m>3</m>.
      Were we to do so, we would be erroneously applying the FTC because
      <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-2)^2}</m> fails to be continuous throughout the interval,
      as seen in <xref ref="F-6-5-InfIntegrand2">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-6-5-InfIntegrand2" permid="JVt">
      <caption>The function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-2)^2}</m> on an interval including <m>x = 2</m>.</caption>
      <image width="47%" source="images/6_5_InfIntegrand2" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="xHb">
      Such an incorrect application of the FTC leads to an impossible result (<m>-2</m>),
      which would itself suggest that something we did must be wrong.
      Instead, we must address the vertical asymptote at <m>x = 2</m> by writing
      <me permid="LKG">
        \int_1^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx = \lim_{a \to 2^-} \int_1^a \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx + \lim_{b \to 2^+} \int_b^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx
      </me>.
      We then evaluate two separate limits of proper integrals.
      For instance,
      doing so for the integral with <m>a</m> approaching <m>2</m> from the left, we find
      <md permid="rRP">
        <mrow>\int_1^2 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx&amp;= \lim_{a \to 2^-} \int_1^a \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= \lim_{a \to 2^-} -\frac{1}{(x-2)} \bigg\vert_1^a</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= \lim_{a \to 2^-} -\frac{1}{(a-2)} + \frac{1}{1-2}</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp;= \infty</mrow>
      </md>,
      since <m>\frac{1}{a-2} \to -\infty</m> as <m>a</m> approaches 2 from the left.
      Thus, the improper integral <m>\int_1^2 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx</m> diverges;
      similar work shows that <m>\int_2^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx</m> also diverges.
      From either of these two results,
      we can conclude that that the original integral,
      <m>\int_1^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx</m> diverges, too.
