    <p permid="EPO">
      Early on in our work with the definite integral,
      we learned that for an object moving along an axis,
      the area under a non-negative velocity function <m>v</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> tells us the distance the object traveled on that time interval,
      and that area is given precisely by the definite integral <m>\int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m>.
      In general, for any nonnegative function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m> measures the area bounded by the curve and the <m>x</m>-axis between <m>x = a</m> and <m>x = b</m>.

      Next,
      we will explore how definite integrals can be used to represent other physically important properties.

    <title>The Area Between Two Curves</title>
    <idx><h>area</h></idx>

    <p permid="Reg">
      In <xref ref="PA-6-1">Preview Activity</xref>,
      we saw a natural way to think about the area between two curves:
      it is the area beneath the upper curve minus the area below the lower curve.
    </p>

    <example permid="EfU">
      <statement>
        <p permid="gne">
          Find the area bounded between the graphs of
          <m>f(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1</m> and <m>g(x) = x+2</m>.

      <solution permid="cIE">
        <p permid="WTs">
          In <xref ref="F-6-1-PA1revisited">Figure</xref>,
          we see that the graphs intersect at <m>(0,2)</m> and <m>(3,5)</m>.
          We can find these intersection points algebraically by solving the system of equations given by
          <m>y = x+2</m> and <m>y = (x-1)^2 + 1</m>:
          substituting <m>x+2</m> for <m>y</m> in the second equation yields <m>x+2 = (x-1)^2 + 1</m>,
          so <m>x+2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1</m>, and thus
          <me permid="DKv">
            x^2 - 3x = x(x-3) = 0
          </me>,
          from which it follows that <m>x = 0</m> or <m>x = 3</m>.
          Using <m>y = x+2</m>,
          we find the corresponding <m>y</m>-values of the intersection points.
        </p>

        <p permid="DaB">
          On the interval <m>[0,3]</m>,
          the area beneath <m>g</m> is
          <me permid="jRE">
            \int_0^3 (x+2) \, dx = \frac{21}{2}
          </me>,
          while the area under <m>f</m> on the same interval is
          <me permid="PYN">
            \int_0^3 [(x-1)^2 + 1] \, dx = 6
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="jhK">
          Thus, the area between the curves is
          <men xml:id="E-DiffOfInt" permid="wfW">
            A = \int_0^3 (x+2) \, dx -  \int_0^3 [(x-1)^2 + 1] \, dx = \frac{21}{2} - 6 = \frac{9}{2}
          </men>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="xlp">
      We can also think of the area this way:
      if we slice up the region between two curves into thin vertical rectangles
      (in the same spirit as we originally sliced the region between a single curve and the <m>x</m>-axis in <xref ref="sec-4-2-Riemann">Section</xref>),
      we see (as shown in <xref ref="F-6-1-PA1revisited2">Figure</xref>) that the height of a typical rectangle is given by the difference between the two functions,
      <m>g(x) - f(x)</m>,
      and its width is <m>\Delta x</m>.
      Thus the area of the rectangle is
      <me permid="cnf">
        A_{\text{rect} } = (g(x) - f(x)) \Delta x
      </me>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-6-1-PA1revisited2" permid="icr">
      <caption>The area bounded by the functions <m>f(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1</m> and <m>g(x) = x+2</m> on the interval <m>[0,3]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/6_1_PA1revisited2" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="dsy">
      The area between the two curves on <m>[0,3]</m> is thus approximated by the Riemann sum
      <me permid="Iuo">
        A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} (g(x_i) - f(x_i)) \Delta x
      </me>,
      and as we let <m>n \to \infty</m>,
      it follows that the area is given by the single definite integral
      <men xml:id="E-IntOfDiff" permid="oBx">
        A = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JzH">
      In many applications of the definite integral,
      we will find it helpful to think of a
      <q>representative slice</q>
      and use the definite integral to add these slices.
      Here, the integral sums the areas of thin rectangles.
    </p>

    <p permid="pGQ">
      Finally, it doesn't matter whether we think of the area between two curves as the difference between the area bounded by the individual curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="E-DiffOfInt" />)
      or as the limit of a Riemann sum of the areas of thin rectangles between the curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="E-IntOfDiff" />).
      These two results are the same,
      since the difference of two integrals is the integral of the difference:
      <me permid="UIG">
        \int_0^3 g(x) \, dx -  \int_0^3 f(x) \, dx = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="VNZ">
      Our work so far in this section illustrates the following general principle.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="LKt">
      <p permid="BVi">
        If two curves <m>y = g(x)</m> and

        and for all <m>x</m> such that
        <m>a \le x \le b</m>, <m>g(x) \ge f(x)</m>,
        then the area between the curves is <m>A = \int_a^b (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx</m>.

    <title>Finding Area with Horizontal Slices</title>
    <p permid="OjA">
      At times, the shape of a region may dictate that we use horizontal rectangular slices,
      instead of vertical ones.
    </p>

    <example permid="knd">
      <statement>
        <p permid="sBw">
          Find the area of the region bounded by the parabola

        </figure>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="IPN">
        <p permid="vwc">
          By solving the second equation for <m>x</m> and writing <m>x = y + 1</m>,
          we find that <m>y+1 = y^2 - 1</m>.
          Hence the curves intersect where <m>y^2 - y - 2 = 0</m>.
          Thus, we find <m>y = -1</m> or <m>y = 2</m>,
          so the intersection points of the two curves are <m>(0,-1)</m> and <m>(3,2)</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="bDl">
          If we attempt to use vertical rectangles to slice up the area
          (as in the center graph 
          of <xref ref="F-6-1-IntWRTy">Figure</xref>),
          we see that
          from <m>x = -1</m> to <m>x = 0</m>
          the curves that bound the top and bottom of the rectangle are one and the same.
          This suggests, as shown in the rightmost graph in the figure,
          that we try using horizontal rectangles.
        </p>

        <p permid="HKu">
          Note that the width of a horizontal rectangle depends on <m>y</m>.
          Between <m>y = -1</m> and <m>y = 2</m>,
          the right end of a representative rectangle is determined by the line 
          <m>x = y+1</m>,
          and the left end is determined by the parabola, <m>x = y^2-1</m>.
          The thickness of the rectangle is <m>\Delta y</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="nRD">
          Therefore, the area of the rectangle is

            A_{\text{rect} } = [(y+1) - (y^2-1)] \Delta y
          </me>,
          and the area between the two curves on the <m>y</m>-interval <m>[-1,2]</m> is approximated by the Riemann sum
          <me permid="gWY">
            A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} [(y_i+1)-(y_i^2-1)] \Delta y

        <p permid="TYM">
          Taking the limit of the Riemann sum,
          it follows that the area of the region is

        </p>

        <p permid="AfV">
          We emphasize that we are integrating with respect to <m>y</m>;
          this is because we chose to use horizontal rectangles whose widths depend on <m>y</m> and whose thickness is denoted <m>\Delta y</m>.
          It is a straightforward exercise to evaluate the integral in <xref ref="E-IntWRTy">Equation</xref>

      Just as with the use of vertical rectangles of thickness <m>\Delta x</m>,

    <title>Finding the length of a curve</title>
    <idx><h>arc length</h></idx>

    <p permid="GFb">
      We can also use the definite integral to find the length of a portion of a curve.
      We use the same fundamental principle:
      we slice the curve up into small pieces whose lengths we can easily approximate.
      Specifically,
      we subdivide the curve into small approximating line segments,
      as shown at left in <xref ref="F-6-1-ArcLength">Figure</xref>.

      <image width="100%" source="images/6_1_ArcLength" />

    <p permid="mMk">
      We estimate the length
      <m>L_{\text{slice} }</m> of each portion of the curve on a small interval of length <m>\Delta x</m>.
      We use the right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes and hypotenuse connecting the endpoints of the slice,
      as seen at right in <xref ref="F-6-1-ArcLength">Figure</xref>.
      The length, <m>h</m>,
      of the hypotenuse approximates the length,
      <m>L_{\text{slice} }</m>, of the curve between the two selected points.
      Thus,
      <me permid="Zsz">

      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="STt">
      Next we use algebra to rearrange the expression for the length of the hypotenuse
      into a form that we can integrate.
