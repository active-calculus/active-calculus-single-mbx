  <introduction permid="MHv">
    <p permid="oOF">
      In <xref ref="C-1">Chapter</xref>,
      we developed the concept of the derivative of a function.
      We now know that the derivative <m>f'</m> of a function <m>f</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
      The derivative also tells us the slope of the tangent line to <m>y=f(x)</m> at any given value of <m>x</m>.
      So far, we have focused on interpreting the derivative graphically or,
      in the context of a physical setting,
      as a meaningful rate of change.
      To calculate the value of the derivative at a specific point,
      we have relied on the limit definition of the derivative,
      <me permid="zXE">
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="UVO">
      In this chapter,
      we investigate how the limit definition of the derivative      
      leads to interesting patterns and rules that enable us to find a formula for <m>f'(x)</m> quickly,
      <em>without</em>
      using the limit definition directly.
      For example,
      we would like to apply shortcuts to differentiate a function such as <m>g(x) = 4x^7 - \sin(x) + 3e^x</m>

  <subsection permid="yDQ">
    <title>Some Key Notation</title>
    <p permid="BcX">
      In addition to our usual <m>f'</m> notation,
      there are other ways to denote the derivative of a function,
      as well as the instruction to take the derivative.
      If we are thinking about the relationship between <m>y</m> and <m>x</m>,
      we sometimes denote the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> by the symbol
      <me permid="geN">
        \frac{dy}{dx}
      </me>
      which we read <q>dee-y dee-x.</q>
      For example, if <m>y = x^2</m>,
      we'll write that the derivative is <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x</m>.
      This notation comes from the fact that the derivative is related to the slope of a line,
      and slope is measured by <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>.
      Note that while we read <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m> as
      <q>change in <m>y</m> over change in <m>x</m>,</q> we view
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> as a single symbol,
      not a quotient of two quantities.
    </p>

    <p permid="hkg">
      We use a variant of this notation as the instruction to take the derivative.
      In particular,
      <me permid="MlW">
        \frac{d}{dx}\left[ \Box \right]
      </me>
      means <q>take the derivative of the quantity in <m>\Box</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</q>
      For example, we may write <m>\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] = 2x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Nrp">
      It is important to note that the independent variable can be different from <m>x</m>.
      If we have <m>f(z) = z^2</m>,
      we then write <m>f'(z) = 2z</m>.
      Similarly, if <m>y = t^2</m>,
      we say <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t</m>.
      And it is also true that <m>\frac{d}{dq}[q^2] = 2q</m>.
      This notation may also be used for second derivatives:
      <m>f''(z) = \frac{d}{dz}\left[\frac{df}{dz}\right] = \frac{d^2 f}{dz^2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="tyy">
      In what follows,
      we'll build a repertoire of functions for which we can quickly compute the derivative.

    <title>Constant, Power, and Exponential Functions</title>
    <p permid="ZFH">
      So far, we know the derivative formula for two important classes of functions:
      constant functions and power functions.
      If
      <m>f(x) = c</m> is a constant function,
      its graph is a horizontal line with slope zero at every point.
      Thus, <m>\frac{d}{dx}[c] = 0</m>.
      We summarize this with the following rule.

      In your work in <xref ref="PA-2-1">Preview Activity</xref>,
      you conjectured that for any positive integer <m>n</m>,
      if <m>f(x) = x^n</m>, then <m>f'(x) = nx^{n-1}</m>.
      This rule can be formally proved for any positive integer <m>n</m>,
      and also for any nonzero real number
      (positive or negative).

    <p permid="yir">
      It will be instructive to have a derivative formula for one more type of basic function.
      For now, we simply state this rule without explanation or justification;
      we will explore why this rule is true in one of the exercises.
      And we will encounter graphical reasoning for why the rule is plausible in <xref ref="PA-2-2">Preview Activity</xref>.

          Similarly, for <m>p(t) = 10^t</m>,
          <m>p'(t) = 10^t \ln(10)</m>.
          It is especially important to note that when <m>a = e</m>,

          This is an extremely important property of the function <m>e^x</m>:
          its derivative function is itself!

    <p permid="KwJ">
      Note carefully the distinction between power functions and exponential functions:
      in power functions, the variable is in the base, as in <m>x^2</m>,
      while in exponential functions,
      the variable is in the power, as in <m>2^x</m>.
      As we can see from the rules,
      this makes a big difference in the form of the derivative.

    <title>Constant Multiples and Sums of Functions</title>
    <p permid="qDS">
      Next we will learn how to compute the derivative of a function constructed as an algebraic combination of basic functions.
      For instance,
      we'd like to be able to take the derivative of a polynomial function such as
      <me permid="YAo">
        p(t) = 3t^5 - 7t^4 + t^2 - 9
      </me>,
      which is a sum of constant multiples of powers of <m>t</m>.
      To that end, we develop two new rules:
      the Constant Multiple Rule and the Sum Rule.
    </p>

    <p permid="WLb">
      How is the derivative of <m>y = kf(x)</m> related to the derivative of <m>y = f(x)</m>?
      Recall that when we multiply a function by a constant <m>k</m>,
      we vertically stretch the graph by a factor of <m>|k|</m>
      (and reflect the graph across <m>y = 0</m> if <m>k \lt 0</m>).
      This vertical stretch affects the slope of the graph,
      so the slope of the function
      <m>y = kf(x)</m> is <m>k</m> times as steep as the slope of <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      Thus, when we multiply a function by a factor of <m>k</m>,
      we change the value of its derivative by a factor of <m>k</m> as well.<fn>
      The Constant Multiple Rule can be formally proved as a consequence of properties of limits,
      using the limit definition of the derivative.

      <m>(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</m>.
      Not only is the value of the new function the sum of the values of the two known functions,
      but the slope of the new function is the sum of the slopes of the known functions.

      Like the Constant Multiple Rule,
      the Sum Rule can be formally proved as a consequence of properties of limits,

      <m>y = (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)</m> as <m>y = f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))</m>,
      the Sum Rule and Constant Multiple Rules together tell us that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))] = f'(x) - g'(x)</m>,

      As we work with the algebraic structure of functions,

        <li permid="pTY">
          The derivative of any polynomial function will be another polynomial function,
          and that the degree of the derivative is one less than the degree of the original function.
          For instance, if <m>p(t) = 7t^5 - 4t^3 + 8t</m>,
          <m>p</m> is a degree 5 polynomial, and its derivative,
          <m>p'(t) = 35t^4 - 12t^2 + 8</m>, is a degree 4 polynomial.
        </li>

        <li permid="Wbh">
          The derivative of any exponential function is another exponential function:
          for example, if <m>g(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z</m>,
          then <m>g'(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z \ln(2)</m>,
