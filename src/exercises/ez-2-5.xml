            <p>
              Since <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m>, by the chain rule we know that <m>h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)</m>.  Using the facts that <m>f(x)=x^3</m> and <m>g(x) = \sin(x)</m>, it follows <m>f'(x) = 3x^2</m> and <m>f'(g(x)) = 3\sin^2(x)</m>, and <m>g'(x) = \cos(x)</m>.  Therefore, 
              <me>
                h'(x) = 3\sin^2(x) \cdot \cos(x)
              </me>
              and <m>h'\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = 3 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Note that <m>r'(x) = g'(f(x)) \cdot f'(x) = \cos(x^3) \cdot 3x^2</m>.  Thus, we have <m>r'(0.25) = \cos(0.25^3) \cdot 3(0.25)^2 \approx 0.1875</m>, while using our work from (a), <m>h'(0.25) = 3\sin^2(0.25) \cdot \cos(0.25) \approx 0.1779</m>, so since <m>|h'(0.25) \lt r'(0.25)|</m>, we see that <m>r</m> is changing more rapidly.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have observed in (a) and (b) that <m>h'(x) = 3\sin^2(x) \cdot \cos(x)</m> and <m>r'(x) = \cos(x^3) \cdot 3x^2</m>.  Because both parts of the product in <m>h'(x)</m> are periodic functions, <m>h'(x)</m> is periodic (with period <m>2\pi</m>).  However, <m>r'(x)</m> is not periodic, since <m>3x^2</m> grows without bound as <m>x</m> increases.

              In (a) we are determining the instantaneous rate at which the volume changes as we increase the height of the water in the tank, while in (c) we are finding the instantaneous rate at which volume changes as we increase time.

              We are asked to find <m>\frac{dV}{dh}</m> (the derivative of <m>V</m> with respect to the independent variable <m>h</m>) at the instant <m>h = 1</m>. If we first expand <m>V</m> to write 
              <me>
                V = \frac{\pi}{3}\left(12h^2 - h^3\right)
              </me>
              we find that 
              <me>
                \frac{dV}{dh} = \frac{\pi}{3} \left(24h - 3h^2\right) = \pi \left(8h-h^2 \right),
              </me>
              with units ``cubic feet per foot''.

              Now we want to find <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m>, the derivative of <m>V</m> with respect to the independent variable <m>t</m>. Here we can write <m>V</m> as a function of <m>t</m> by writing <m>V(t) = \frac{\pi}{3}\left(12(h(t))^2 - (h(t))^3\right)</m>, where <m>h(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1</m>.  By the chain rule, it follows that 
              <me>
                \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{3}\left( 12 \cdot 2 h(t) \cdot h'(t) - 3 (h(t))^2 \cdot h'(t) \right)
              </me>
              and hence using <m>h(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1</m> and <m>h'(t) = \pi \cos(\pi t)</m>,
              <me>
                \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{3}\left[ 12 \cdot 2 (\sin(\pi t) + 1) \cdot \pi \cos(\pi t) - 3 (\sin(\pi t) + 1)^2 \cdot \pi \cos(\pi t) \right]
              </me>

            <p>
              Now we want to find <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> when <m>t=0</m>. Using the result from part (b), we have
              <me>
                \left. \frac{dV}{dt} \right|_{t=0} = \frac{\pi}{3}\left[ 12 \cdot 2 (\sin(0) + 1) \cdot \pi \cos(0) - 3 (\sin(0) + 1)^2 \cdot \pi \cos(0) \right] = 7 \pi^2
              </me>
              cubic feet per hour.

              In (a) we are determining the instantaneous rate at which the volume changes as we increase the height of the water in the tank, while in (c) we are finding the instantaneous rate at which volume changes as we increase time.  The first calculation is a direct one, while the second is more indirect, as it involves the composition of <m>V</m> with <m>h</m> as a function of time.  In the latter case, both <m>h</m> and <m>V</m> are functions of time, which allows us to think not only of how <m>V</m> is changing as a function of <m>h</m>, but also as a function of <m>t</m>.
