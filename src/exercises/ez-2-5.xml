Consider the basic functions <m>f(x) = x^3</m> and <m>g(x) = \sin(x)</m>.
  <ol>
    <li><p>Let <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m>.  Find the exact instantaneous rate of change of <m>h</m> at the point where <m>x = \frac{\pi}{4}.</m></p></li>
    <li><p>Which function is changing most rapidly at <m>x = 0.25</m>:  <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m> or <m>r(x) = g(f(x))</m>?  Why?</p></li>
    <li><p>Let <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m> and <m>r(x) = g(f(x))</m>.  Which of these functions has a derivative that is periodic?  Why?</p></li>

<statement>
<p>
If a spherical tank of radius 4 feet has <m>h</m> feet of water present in the tank, then the volume of water in the tank is given by the formula
<me>
  V = \frac{\pi}{3} h^2(12-h).
</me>
  <ol>
    <li><p>At what instantaneous rate is the volume of water in the tank changing with respect to the <em>height</em> of the water at the instant <m>h = 1</m>?  What are the units on this quantity?</p></li>
    <li><p>Now suppose that the height of water in the tank is being regulated by an inflow and outflow (e.g., a faucet and a drain) so that the height of the water at time <m>t</m> is given by the rule <m>h(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1</m>, where <m>t</m> is measured in hours (and <m>h</m> is still measured in feet).  At what rate is the height of the water changing with respect to time at the instant <m>t = 2</m>?</p></li>
    <li><p>Continuing under the assumptions in (b), at what instantaneous rate is the volume of water in the tank changing with respect to <em>time</em> at the instant <m>t = 2</m>?</p></li>
    <li><p>What are the main differences between the rates found in (a) and (c)?  Include a discussion of the relevant units.</p></li>
