    <statement>
      <p>
        The logistic equation may be used to model how a rumor spreads
        through a group of people.
        Suppose that <m>p(t)</m> is the fraction of
        people that have heard the rumor on day <m>t</m>.
        The equation
        <me>
          \frac{dp}{dt} = 0.2p(1-p)
        </me>
        describes how <m>p</m> changes.
        Suppose initially that one-tenth of
        the people have heard the rumor;
        that is, <m>p(0) = 0.1</m>.
        <ol label="a.">

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>b(t)</m> measures the number of bacteria living in
        a colony in a Petri dish,
        where <m>b</m> is measured in thousands and
        <m>t</m> is measured in days.
        One day, you measure that there are
        6,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 3.
        A few days
        later,
        you measure that there are 9,000 bacteria and the per
        capita growth rate is 2.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume that the per capita growth rate
              <m>\frac{db/dt}{b}</m> is a linear function of <m>b</m>.
              Use the measurements to find this function and write a logistic equation to describe <m>\frac{db}{dt}</m>.

    <statement>

        Suppose that the population of a species of fish is controlled by
        the logistic equation
        <me>
          \frac{dP}{dt} = 0.1P(10 - P)
        </me>,
        where <m>P</m> is measured in thousands of fish and <m>t</m> is measured in

              Suppose that a long time has passed and that the fish
              population is stable at the carrying capacity.
              At this time,
              humans begin harvesting 20<percent /> of the fish every year.
              Modify the
              differential equation by adding a term to incorporate the
              harvesting of fish.
