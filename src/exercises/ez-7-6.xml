              From the form of the given logistic equation,

              In this situation, the initial condition is <m>P(0) = 10</m>,

              we subtract <m>0.2P</m> from the rate that defines the differential equation,
              thus finding

              Expanding and rewriting the differential equation in (b),

              This, too, is a logistic equation,

              We can solve this logistic equation in the usual way (keeping in mind the initial condition <m>P(0) = 10</m>,
              and noting that the carrying capacity is <m>8</m>):
              <me permid="UzL">
                P(t) = \frac{8}{\frac{8-10}{10}e^{-0.1 \cdot 8 t}+1} = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}
              </me>
              After one year, the population of fish will thus be
              <me permid="AGU">
                P(1) \approx 8.7899
              </me>

              To be within 10<percent /> of the carrying capacity,
              we need <m>0.9(8) \le P(t) \le 1.1(8)</m>.
              Since the initial condition is larger than the carrying capacity,
              we want to know when <m>P(t) = 1.1(8) = 8.8</m>.
              Thus we solve the equation
              <me permid="MVm">
                8.8 = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}
              </me>,
              which implies <m>-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1 = 8/8.8 = 10/11</m>.
              Thus, <m>e^{-0.8t} = 5/11</m>,
              so <m>t = -1.2 \ln(5/11) \approx 0.9461</m> years.
