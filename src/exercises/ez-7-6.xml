    <statement>
      <p>
        The logistic equation may be used to model how a rumor spreads
        through a group of people.
        Suppose that <m>p(t)</m> is the fraction of
        people that have heard the rumor on day <m>t</m>.
        The equation
        <me>
          \frac{dp}{dt} = 0.2p(1-p)
        </me>
        describes how <m>p</m> changes.
        Suppose initially that one-tenth of
        the people have heard the rumor;
        that is, <m>p(0) = 0.1</m>.

        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              The equilibrium solutions for this logistic equation are <m>p = 0</m> and <m>p = 1</m>.  Since <m>p = 1</m> is the carrying capacity and thus a stable equilibrium, <m>p(t) \to 1</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m> provided <m>p(0) \gt 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We know that the general solution to the logistic equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P), \ P(0) = P_0</m>
              is
              <me>
                P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}
              </me>.
              In the context of this problem, we know that <m>k = 0.2</m>, <m>N = 1</m>, and <m>p(0) = 0.1</m> and therefore the solution is
              <me>
                p(t) = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1-0.1}{0.1}\right) e^{-0.2t} + 1} = \frac{1}{9e^{-0.2t} + 1}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We know that <m>p</m> is changing most rapidly when its derivative, <m>p'</m>, is largest.  Recalling the original differential equation, we know that 
              <me>
                p' = 0.2p(1-p)
              </me>
              which shows that <m>p'</m> is a quadratic function of <m>p</m>.  That quadratic function has zeros at <m>p = 0</m> and <m>p = 1</m>, so the vertex of this concave down quadratic function lies at <m>p = \frac{1}{2}</m>, and at this value of <m>p</m> the rate of change of <m>p</m> is largest.  Thus, we solve the equation <m>p(t) = 0.5</m> to find the time at which the population is increasing fastest.  We see that
              <me>
                0.5 = \frac{1}{9e^{-0.2t} + 1}
              </me>
              so
              <me>
                9e^{-0.2t} + 1 = 2
              </me>
              and <m>e^{-0.2t} = 1/9</m>.  It follows that <m>t = -5 \ln(1/9) \approx 10.986</m> days.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>p(t)</m> tells us the percentage of people who've heard the rumor, we need to solve the equation <m>p(t) = 0.8</m>.  Thus we have
              <me>
                0.8 = \frac{1}{9e^{-0.2t} + 1}
              </me>
              so
              <me>
                9e^{-0.2t} + 1 = 1.2
              </me>
              and <m>e^{-0.2t} = 0.2/9</m>.  It follows that <m>t = -5 \ln(0.2/9) \approx 19.033</m> days.

        Suppose that <m>b(t)</m> measures the number of bacteria living in

        One day, you measure that there are
        6,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 3.
        A few days
        later,
        you measure that there are 9,000 bacteria and the per

          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>y</m> be the per capita growth rate as a function of <m>b</m>.  Using the given data in the problem statement, we know that this linear function passes through the points <m>(6000,3)</m> and <m>(9000,2)</m>.  The equation of this line is thus
              <me>
                y - 3 = -\frac{1}{3000}(b - 6000)
              </me>
              so <m>y = (3 + 2) - \frac{1}{3000}b = 5 - \frac{1}{3000}b</m>.  Since the logistic equation comes from taking the product of the population at time <m>t</m> with its per capita growth rate at that time, we find that
              <me>
                \frac{db}{dt} = b \left( 5 - \frac{1}{3000}b \right) = \frac{1}{3000} b(15000 - b)
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              From the form of the logistic equation, we see that the carrying capacity for the bacteria is <m>b = 15000</m>, which is a stable equilibrium for the population.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The bacteria is increasing most rapidly when <m>\frac{db}{dt}</m> is greatest.  Since 
              <me>
                \frac{db}{dt} = \frac{1}{3000} b(15000 - b)
              </me>
              is a quadratic function of <m>b</m>, <m>\frac{db}{dt}</m> is maximized at the vertex of this concave down parabola, which occurs halfway between its zeros: <m>b = 0</m> and <m>b = 15000</m>.  Thus, when <m>b = 7500</m>, the population is growing fastest.  To find the exact <m>t</m>-value when this occurs, we'd need to know an initial condition like in the next part of the problem.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Using <m>b(0) = 1000</m>, we solve the logistic equation IVP with 
              <me>
                \frac{db}{dt} = \frac{1}{3000} b(15000 - b)
              </me>.
              Using <m>N = 15000</m>, <m>k = \frac{1}{3000}</m>, and <m>b_0 = 1000</m>, we know from the standard form of the solution to the logistic equation that
              <me>
                b(t) = \frac{15000}{\left(\frac{15000-1000}{1000}\right) e^{-5t} + 1} = \frac{15000}{14e^{-5t} + 1}
              </me>.
              To find how long it takes the bacteria to reach 80<percent /> of the carrying capacity, we solve the equation
              <me>
                0.8 \cdot 15 = \frac{15000}{14e^{-5t} + 1}
              </me>.
              That equation implies that 
              <me>
                0.8 = \frac{1}{14e^{-5t} + 1}
              </me>,
              so <m>14e^{-5t} + 1 = 1.2</m> and thus <m>e^{-5t} = 0.2/14 = 1/70</m>.  It follows that <m>t = -\frac{1}{5} \ln(1/70) \approx 0.8497</m> days.

              Expanding and rewriting the differential equation in (b), we see that
              <me>
                \frac{dP}{dt} = P - 0.1P^2 - 0.2P = 0.8P - 0.1P^2 = 0.1P(8 - P)
              </me>.
              This, too, is a logistic equation, with carrying capacity <m>8000</m> fish.

          <li>
            <p>
              We can solve this logistic equation in the usual way (keeping in mind the initial condition <m>P(0) = 10</m>, and noting that the carrying capacity is <m>8</m>):
              <me>
                P(t) = \frac{8}{\frac{8-10}{10}e^{-0.1 \cdot 8 t}+1} = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}
              </me>
              After one year, the population of fish will thus be
              <me>
                P(1) \approx 8.7899
              </me>
              thousand fish.

          <li>
            <p>
              To be within 10<percent /> of the carrying capacity, we need <m>0.9(8) \le P(t) \le 1.1(8)</m>.  Since the initial condition is larger than the carrying capacity, we want to know when <m>P(t) = 1.1(8) = 8.8</m>.  Thus we solve the equation
              <me>
                8.8 = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}
              </me>,
              which implies <m>-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1 = 8/8.8 = 10/11</m>.  Thus, <m>e^{-0.8t} = 5/11</m>, so <m>t = -1.2 \ln(5/11) \approx 0.9461</m> years.
