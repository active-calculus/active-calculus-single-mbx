        <statement>
          <p>The logistic equation may be used to model how a rumor spreads
          through a group of people. Suppose that <m>p(t)</m> is the fraction of
          people that have heard the rumor on day <m>t</m>. The equation
          <me>
            \frac{dp}{dt} = 0.2p(1-p)
          </me>
          describes how <m>p</m> changes. Suppose initially that one-tenth of
          the people have heard the rumor; that is, <m>p(0) = 0.1</m>.

          <ol>
            <li><p>What happens to <m>p(t)</m> after a very long time?</p></li>

            <li><p>Determine a formula for the function <m>p(t)</m>.</p></li>

            <li><p>At what time is <m>p</m> changing most rapidly?</p></li>

            <li><p>How long does it take before 80<percent /> of the people have heard
                      the rumor?</p></li>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose that <m>b(t)</m> measures the number of bacteria living in
          a colony in a Petri dish, where <m>b</m> is measured in thousands and
          <m>t</m> is measured in days. One day, you measure that there are
          6,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 3. A few days
          later, you measure that there are 9,000 bacteria and the per
          capita growth rate is 2.

          <ol>
            <li><p>Assume that the per capita growth rate 
                    <m>\frac{db/dt}{b}</m> is a linear function of <m>b</m>.  Use the
                    measurements to find this function and write a logistic equation
                    to describe <m>\frac{db}{dt}</m>.</p></li>

            <li><p>What is the carrying capacity for the bacteria?</p></li>

            <li><p>At what population is the number of bacteria increasing most
                    rapidly?</p></li>

            <li><p>If there are initially 1,000 bacteria, how long will it take
                    to reach 80<percent /> of the carrying capacity?</p></li>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose that the population of a species of fish is controlled by
          the logistic equation
          <me>
            \frac{dP}{dt} = 0.1P(10 - P),
          </me>
          where <m>P</m> is measured in thousands of fish and <m>t</m> is measured in
          years.

          <ol>
            <li><p>What is the carrying capacity of this population?</p></li>

            <li><p>Suppose that a long time has passed and that the fish
                      population is stable at the carrying capacity.  At this time,
                      humans begin harvesting 20<percent /> of the fish every year.  Modify the
                      differential equation by adding a term to incorporate the
                      harvesting of fish.</p></li>

            <li><p>What is the new carrying capacity?</p></li>

            <li><p>What will the fish population be one year after the
                      harvesting begins?</p></li>

            <li><p>How long will it take for the population to be within 10<percent />
                      of the carrying capacity?</p></li>
