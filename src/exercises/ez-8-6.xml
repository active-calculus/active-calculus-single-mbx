          <p>In this exercise we will begin with a strange power series and then find its sum. The Fibonacci sequence <m>\{f_n\}</m> is a famous sequence whose first few terms are

            </me>,
          where each term in the sequence after the first two is the sum of the preceding two terms. That is, <m>f_0 = 0</m>, <m>f_1 = 1</m> and for <m>n \geq 2</m> we have
            <me>
              f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}

          <p>Equation <xref ref="eq-PA-8-6-Airy-sum-3" /> implies that <m>a_2 = 0</m> and <m>(k+1)(k+2)a_{k+2}+a_{k-2} = 0</m> for all <m>k \geq 1</m>.</p>

          <p>Solving for <m>a_{k+2}</m> in the second equation shows that

              <mrow>a_2 \amp = 0</mrow>

          <p>These last equations are called <em>recurrence relations</em> and allow us to write every coefficient of <m>y</m> in terms of <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m>. For example, <m>k=1</m> shows that <m>a_3 = \frac{1}{(2)(3)} a_0 = \frac{1}{6}a_0</m>. We can continue in this way to obtain the first 10 coefficients in terms of <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m>:

          <p>It may not be obvious, but there is a pattern.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>All of the terms involving <m>a_2</m> are 0. These terms are <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_5</m>, <m>a_8</m>, etc. The subscripts of these terms are all of the form <m>3k+2</m>. So <m>a_{3k+2} = 0</m> for every positive integer <m>k</m>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The terms that involve <m>a_0</m> have the form <m>a_3</m>, <m>a_6</m>, <m>a_{9}</m>, etc. and are all of the form <m>a_{3k}</m> for positive integers <m>k</m>. The pattern in the denominators of the coefficient for <m>a_{3k}</m> is <m>(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)</m>. So
                <me>
                  a_{3k} = \frac{1}{(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)} a_0 \text{ for }  k \geq 1

                <me>
                  a_{3k+1} = \frac{1}{(3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)} a_1 \text{ for }  k \geq 1

          <statement>
            <p>A more complicated differential equation is one that governs the motion of a pendulum. Mechanics tells us that the motion of a pendulum of length <m>L</m> with mass <m>m</m> is governed by the differential equation
              <me>
                mL \frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} = -mg \sin(\theta)
              </me>
            where <m>t</m> is time and <m>\theta</m> is the angle the pendulum makes with its vertical axis.</p>

            <p>We do not have the machinery to solve this differential equation exactly, but we can approximate a solution as closely as we like by assuming that a solution <m>\theta</m> has a Taylor series expansion about the origin. In other words, assume that
              <me>
                \theta = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_nt_n
              </me>,
            where the coefficients are undetermined. Then
              <md>
                <mrow>\theta \amp = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_nt_n</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d \theta}{dt} \amp = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} na_nt_{n-1}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} \amp = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} (n-1)na_nt_{n-2}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d^3 \theta}{dt^3} \amp = \sum_{n=3}^{\infty} (n-2)(n-1)na_nt_{n-3}</mrow>
                <mrow>\vdots \amp = \vdots</mrow>
              </md>
            from the series expansion and
              <md>
                <mrow>\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} \amp = -\frac{g}{L} \sin\left(\theta\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d^3 \theta}{dt^3} \amp = -\frac{g}{L}\left[\cos(\theta)\frac{d \theta}{dt}\right]</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d^4 \theta}{dt^4} \amp = -\frac{g}{L}\left[-\sin(\theta)\left(\frac{d \theta}{dt}\right)^2 + \cos(theta)\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} \right]</mrow>
                <mrow>\vdots \amp = \vdots</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>

            <p>If we seek a solution with initial conditions <m>\theta(0) = \frac{\pi}{6}</m> and <m>\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0) = 0</m>, then we have
              <md>
                <mrow>\theta(0) \amp = a_0 = \frac{\pi}{6}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0) \amp = a_1 = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}(0) \amp = 2a_2 = -\frac{g}{L} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = -\frac{g}{2L}</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d^3 \theta}{dt^3}(0) \amp = 6a_3 = -\frac{g}{L}\cos(\theta(0))\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0) = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d^4 \theta}{dt^4}(0) \amp = 24a_4 = -\frac{g}{L}\left[-\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\left(\frac{d \theta}{dt}(0)\right)^2 + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}(0) \right] = -\frac{g}{L}\left[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(-\frac{g}{2L}\right)\right]</mrow>
                <mrow>\vdots \amp = \vdots</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>

            <p>This gives us
              <me>
                a_0 = \frac{\pi}{6}, \ \ a_1 = 0, \ \ a_2 = -\frac{g}{4L}, \ \ a_3 = 0, \ \ a_4 = \frac{\sqrt{3} g^2}{96L^2}
              </me>
            and an approximation of <m>\theta</m> as
            <me>
              \theta \approx \frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{g}{4L}t^2 + \frac{\sqrt{3}g^2}{96L^2} t^4
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>We could keep going to determine more and more terms in this Taylor series for <m>\theta</m>, but the point is that we can use series like this one to approximate functions. The difference between this type of problem and our use of Taylor series is that to determine the terms in a Taylor series, we need to know the function from which we derive the series. In this differential equation example, we didn't know the function <m>\theta</m>, be we could calculate terms in a series expansion for <m>\theta</m> because we had enough information about <m>\theta</m>.</p>
