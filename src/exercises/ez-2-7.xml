    <solution permid="aHW">
      <p permid="KtF">
        First, we compute <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by implicit differentiation.
        Differentiating both sides of the given equation with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>,
        we see that
        <me permid="Yxk">
          6y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} - 5y^4 \frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x
        </me>.
        Removing a factor of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> from the lefthand side and dividing to solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, we have
        <me permid="EEt">
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x}{6y^2 + 2y - 5y^4} = \frac{2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1)}{y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2)}
        </me>.
        The tangent line is potentially horizontal where the numerator of
        <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is zero and potentially vertical where <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is zero.
        Solving <m>2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1) = 0</m>, we see that
        <me permid="kLC">
          2x(2x-1)(x-1) = 0
        </me>
        so the numerator is zero at <m>x = 0, 0.5, 1</m>.
        The denominator is zero where <m>y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2) = 0</m>.
        Using technology to estimate where <m>-5y^3 + 6y + 2 = 0</m>,
        we see the denominator is zero at <m>y = 0</m> and <m>y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="qAO">
        Next, we need to find the coordinates of these points where potential horizontal or vertical tangent lines occur.
        First, we consider the potential horizontal tangent line locations.
        When <m>x = 0</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0</m>,
        and thus we know <m>y^2(2y + 1 - y^3) = 0</m>,
        from which it follows that <m>y = 0</m>,
        <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.
        This leads to four points to consider:
        <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(0,-1)</m>,
        <m>(0,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(0,1.618)</m>.
        It is apparent from the graph shown below that the tangent line at <m>(0,0)</m> is not horizontal
        (here both the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> are zero),
        but at each of the other three points,
        the tangent line is horizontal.
      </p>

      <p permid="WHX">
        We now reason similarly for the other <m>x</m>-values where the numerator is zero.
        At <m>x = 1</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 1^4 - 2\cdot 1^3 + 1^2 = 0</m>,
        and here again <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.
        This leads to four potential points where the tangent line is horizontal:
        <m>(1,0)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>,
        <m>(1,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(1,1.618)</m>.
        At <m>(1,0)</m>, there's not a horizontal tangent line,
        but at each of the others there is, as seen in the figure.
        Similar reasoning when <m>x = 0.5</m> shows that <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 0.5^4 - 2\cdot 0.5^3 + 0.5^2 = 0.625</m>,
        from which we find that <m>y \approx -1.0493, 0.2104, 1.6139</m>,
        and thus the three points <m>(0.5,-1.0493)</m>,
        <m>(0.5,0.2104)</m>, <m>(0.5, 1.6139)</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="CPg">
        Returning to where the denominator is zero (<m>y = 0</m> and <m>y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235</m>),
        we now determine points where the tangent line is vertical.
        Is is apparent from the figure below that there are no vertical tangent lines when <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y \approx -0.856</m>,
        so there are two values to pursue:
        <m>y \approx -0.379, 1.235</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="iWp">
        When <m>y \approx -0.379</m>,
        it follows that <m>2(-0.379)^3+(-0.379)^2-(-0.379)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so
        <me permid="QSL">
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0.0426
        </me>
        from which we find that <m>x \approx -0.1756, 0.2912, 0.7088, 1.1756</m>.
        The figure confirms that there are vertical tangent lines at <m>(-0.1756,-0.379)</m>,
        <m>(0.2912,-0.379)</m>, <m>(0.7088,-0.379)</m>,
        and <m>(1.1756,-0.379)</m>
      </p>

      <p permid="Pdy">
        Lastly, when <m>y \approx 1.235</m>,
        it follows <m>2(1.235)^3+(1.235)^2-(1.235)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so
        <me permid="wZU">
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 2.4195
        </me>
        and thus via technology, <m>x \approx -0.8437, 1.8437</m>.
        This leads to two additional points at which the tangent line is vertical:
        <m>(-0.8437, 1.235)</m> and <m>(1.8437, 1.235)</m>.

      <p permid="brQ">
        First we need to find the slope of the line tangent to the curve,
        or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
        To do so, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>,
        treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> to obtain
        <md permid="BJN">
          <mrow>\frac{d}{dx} \left( \sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) \right) &amp;= \frac{d}{dx}(1)</mrow>
          <mrow>\cos(x+y) \left(1+\frac{dy}{dx}\right) - \sin(x-y)\left(1-\frac{dy}{dx}\right) &amp;= 0</mrow>
        </md>.
        Distributing on the left side of the equation,
        <me permid="dhd">
          \cos(x+y) + \cos(x+y)\frac{dy}{dx} - \sin(x-y) + \sin(x-y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
        </me>.
        Removing a factor of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> from two terms on the right and moving the other two terms to the righthand side,
        <me permid="Jom">
          \frac{dy}{dx} \left(\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y) \right) =  \sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y)
        </me>.
        Therefore,
        <me permid="pvv">
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y)}{\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y)}

        At the point <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> we have that

          \frac{dy}{dx}\biggm|_{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sin(0)-\cos(\pi)}{\cos(\pi) + \sin(0)} = -1
        </me>.
        Therefore, the equation of the line tangent to the curve at the point
        <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> is <m>y = \frac{\pi}{2} - \left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m>.
        A portion of the graph of the curve defined by
