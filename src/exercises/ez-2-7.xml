        Consider the curve given by the equation <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>.
        Find all points at which the tangent line to the curve is horizontal or vertical.
        Be sure to use a graphing utility to plot this implicit curve and to visually check the results of algebraic reasoning that you use to determine where the tangent lines are horizontal and vertical.

    <answer>
      <p>
        Horizontal tangent lines: <m>(0,-1)</m>, <m>(0,-0.618)</m>, <m>(0,1.618)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>, <m>(1,-0.618)</m>, <m>(1,1.618)</m>, <m>(0.5,-1.0493)</m>, <m>(0.5,0.2104)</m>, <m>(0.5, 1.6139)</m>.

    <solution>
      <p>
        First, we compute <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by implicit differentiation.  Differentiating both sides of the given equation with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>, we see that 
        <me>
          6y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} - 5y^4 \frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x.
        </me>
        Removing a factor of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> from the lefthand side and dividing to solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, we have 
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x}{6y^2 + 2y - 5y^4} = \frac{2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1)}{y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2)}.
        </me>
        The tangent line is potentially horizontal where the numerator of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is zero and potentially vertical where <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is zero.  Solving <m>2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1) = 0</m>, we see that 
        <me>
          2x(2x-1)(x-1) = 0
        </me>
        so the numerator is zero at <m>x = 0, 0.5, 1</m>.  The denominator is zero where <m>y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2) = 0</m>.  Using technology to estimate where <m>-5y^3 + 6y + 2 = 0</m>, we see the denominator is zero at <m>y = 0</m> and <m>y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we need to find the coordinates of these points where potential horizontal or vertical tangent lines occur.  First, we consider the potential horizontal tangent line locations.  When <m>x = 0</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0</m>, and thus we know <m>y^2(2y + 1 - y^3) = 0</m>, from which it follows that <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.  This leads to four points to consider: <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(0,-1)</m>, <m>(0,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(0,1.618)</m>.  It is apparent from the graph shown below that the tangent line at <m>(0,0)</m> is not horizontal (here both the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> are zero), but at each of the other three points, the tangent line is horizontal.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now reason similarly for the other <m>x</m>-values where the numerator is zero.  At <m>x = 1</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 1^4 - 2\cdot 1^3 + 1^2 = 0</m>, and here again <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.  This leads to four potential points where the tangent line is horizontal: <m>(1,0)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>, <m>(1,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(1,1.618)</m>.  At <m>(1,0)</m>, there's not a horizontal tangent line, but at each of the others there is, as seen in the figure.  Similar reasoning when <m>x = 0.5</m> shows that <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 0.5^4 - 2\cdot 0.5^3 + 0.5^2 = 0.625</m>, from which we find that <m>y \approx -1.0493, 0.2104, 1.6139</m>, and thus the three points <m>(0.5,-1.0493)</m>, <m>(0.5,0.2104)</m>, <m>(0.5, 1.6139)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning to where the denominator is zero (<m>y = 0</m> and <m>y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235</m>), we now determine points where the tangent line is vertical.  Is is apparent from the figure below that there are no vertical tangent lines when <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y \approx -0.856</m>, so there are two values to pursue: <m>y \approx -0.379, 1.235</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <m>y \approx -0.379</m>, it follows that <m>2(-0.379)^3+(-0.379)^2-(-0.379)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so 
        <me>
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0.0426
        </me>
        from which we find that <m>x \approx -0.1756, 0.2912, 0.7088, 1.1756</m>.  The figure confirms that there are vertical tangent lines at <m>(-0.1756,-0.379)</m>, <m>(0.2912,-0.379)</m>, <m>(0.7088,-0.379)</m>, and <m>(1.1756,-0.379)</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, when <m>y \approx 1.235</m>, it follows <m>2(1.235)^3+(1.235)^2-(1.235)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so
        <me>
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 2.4195
        </me>
        and thus via technology, <m>x \approx -0.8437, 1.8437</m>.  This leads to two additional points at which the tangent line is vertical:  <m>(-0.8437, 1.235)</m> and <m>(1.8437, 1.235)</m>.

    <solution>
      <p>
        First we need to find the slope of the line tangent to the curve, or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. To do so, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>, treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> to obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{d}{dx} \left( \sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) \right) &amp;= \frac{d}{dx}(1) </mrow>
          <mrow>\cos(x+y) \left(1+\frac{dy}{dx}\right) - \sin(x-y)\left(1-\frac{dy}{dx}\right) &amp;= 0.</mrow>
        </md>
        Distributing on the left side of the equation,
        <me>
          \cos(x+y) + \cos(x+y)\frac{dy}{dx} - \sin(x-y) + \sin(x-y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0. 
        </me>
        Removing a factor of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> from two terms on the right and moving the other two terms to the righthand side, 
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} \left(\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y) \right) =  \sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y).
        </me>
        Therefore,
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y)}{\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y)}.
        </me>
        At the point <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> we have that 
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx}\biggm|_{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sin(0)-\cos(\pi)}{\cos(\pi) + \sin(0)} = -1.
        </me>
        Therefore, the equation of the line tangent to the curve at the point <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> is <m>y = \frac{\pi}{2} - \left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m>.  A portion of the graph of the curve defined by <m>\sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) = 1</m> and the tangent line to the curve at the point <m>\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> are shown in the following figure.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Implicit differentiation enables us a different perspective from which to see why the rule <m>\frac{d}{dx} [a^x] = a^x \ln(a)</m> holds,
        if we assume that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}</m>.
        This exercise leads you through the key steps to do so.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>y = a^x</m>.
              Rewrite this equation using the natural logarithm function to write <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m> (and the constant <m>a</m>).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Differentiate both sides of the equation you found in (a) with respect to <m>x</m>,
              keeping in mind that <m>y</m> is implicitly a function of <m>x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Solve the equation you found in (b) for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,
              and then use the definition of <m>y</m> to write
              <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> solely in terms of <m>x</m>.
              What have you found?

        <ol label="a.">

              Taking the natural log of both sides, <m>\ln(y) = \ln(a^x) = x \ln(a)</m>.  Thus, it follows that
              <me>

              Remembering that <m>\ln(a)</m> is constant with respect to <m>x</m>, we can also write <m>x = \frac{1}{\ln(a)} \cdot \ln(y)</m>.  Differentiating both sides with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> (and again remembering that <m>\ln(a)</m> is constant), we have
              <me>

              <me>
                \frac{dy}{dx} = a^x \ln(a)
