  For each of the following prompts, give an example of a function that satisfies the stated criteria. A formula or a graph, with reasoning, is sufficient for each. If no such example is possible, explain why.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li><p>A function <m>f</m> that is continuous at <m>a = 2</m> but not differentiable at <m>a = 2</m>.</p></li>
      <li><p>A function <m>g</m> that is differentiable at <m>a = 3</m> but does not have a limit at <m>a=3</m>.</p></li>
      <li><p>A function <m>h</m> that has a limit at <m>a = -2</m>, is defined at <m>a = -2</m>, but is not continuous at <m>a = -2</m>.</p></li>
      <li><p>A function <m>p</m> that satisfies all of the following:
      <ul>
      <li><p><m>p(-1) = 3</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -1} p(x) = 2</m></p></li>

  <statement>
  <p>
  Let <m>h(x)</m> be a function whose derivative <m>y= h'(x)</m> is given by the graph on the right in <xref ref="F-1-7-Ez3">Figure</xref>.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li><p>Based on the graph of <m>y = h'(x)</m>, what can you say about the behavior of the function <m>y = h(x)</m>?</p></li>
      <li><p>At which values of <m>x</m> is <m>y = h'(x)</m> not defined?  What behavior does this lead you to expect to see in the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m>?</p></li>
      <li><p>Is it possible for <m>y = h(x)</m> to have points where <m>h</m> is not continuous?  Explain your answer.</p></li>
      <li><p>On the axes provided at left, sketch at least two distinct graphs that are possible functions <m>y = h(x)</m> that each have a derivative <m>y = h'(x)</m> that matches the provided graph at right.  Explain why there are multiple possibilities for <m>y = h(x)</m>.</p></li>

<exercise>
  <statement>
  <p>
  Consider the function <m>g(x) = \sqrt{|x|}</m>.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li><p>Use a graph to explain visually why <m>g</m> is not differentiable at <m>x = 0</m>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that
      <me>
        g'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{|h|}}{h}.
      </me></p></li>
      <li><p>Investigate the value of <m>g'(0)</m> by estimating the limit in (b) using small positive and negative values of <m>h</m>.  For instance, you might compute <m>\frac{\sqrt{|-0.01|}}{0.01}</m>.  Be sure to use several different values of <m>h</m> (both positive and negative), including ones closer to 0 than 0.01.  What do your results tell you about <m>g'(0)</m>?</p></li>
      <li><p>Use your graph in (a) to sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = g'(x)</m>.</p></li>
