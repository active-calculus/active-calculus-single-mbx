        Based on the given information about each function,
        decide whether the function has global maximum,

        or that it is not possible to say without more information.
        Assume that each function is twice differentiable and defined for all real numbers,
        unless noted otherwise.

          <li>
            <p>
              It's not possible to say without more information:  for instance, the functions <m>f(x) = e^{-x}</m>, <m>f(x) = e^{-x}</m>, and <m>f(x) = x^2</m> are each always concave up, but only one of them has a global minimum.  We can say for sure that by being always concave up, <m>f</m> cannot have a global maximum, and it also cannot have both a global maximum and a global minimum.  It might have a global minimum, or it might have neither. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              By being twice differentiable, we know that <m>g'(x) = 0</m> any time <m>x</m> is a critical number of <m>g</m>.  Thus, given the signs of <m>g'(x)</m> on the stated intervals, <m>g</m> is decreasing before <m>x = a</m> and decreasing on <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>, with a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = a</m>.  In addition, <m>g</m> is increasing for <m>x \gt b</m>.  Thus, we know that <m>g</m> has a global minimum at <m>x = a</m>.  
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>h</m> is always decreasing for <m>x \lt a</m>, always increasing for <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>, and always decreasing for <m>x \gt b</m>, we know that <m>h</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = a</m> and a local maximum at <m>x = b</m>.  Moreover, these local extremes are both global extremes since <m>h(x) to 0</m> as <m>x \to \pm \infty</m>.  In particular, since <m>h(x)</m> decreases to <m>0</m> for <m>x \gt b</m> and increases on <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>, it follows that <m>h(b)</m> is the largest value of <m>h(x)</m> on <m>(a, \infty)</m>, and that <m>h(b) \gt 0</m>.  Similarly, since <m>h(x)</m> decreases on <m>(-\infty, a)</m> and approaches <m>0</m> as <m>x \to -\infty</m>, and <m>h(x)</m> increases on <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>, it must be the case that <m>h(a)</m> is the least value of <m>h(x)</m> on <m>(-\infty, b)</m> and that <m>h(b) \lt 0</m>.  Hence, <m>h(x)</m> is always negative on <m>x \lt a</m> and <m>h(x)</m> is always positive on <m>x \gt b</m>.  From all of these observations, it follows that <m>h</m> has a global minimum at <m>x = a</m> and a global maximum at <m>x = b</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              First, observe that <m>p</m> is defined for all real numbers by assumption, so <m>p(a)</m> has some finite value.  However, <m>p</m> is not differentiable at <m>x = a</m> and <m>p</m> is concave up to the left of <m>x = a</m> and concave down to the right of <m>x = a</m>.  This indicates that <m>p</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = a</m>.  Not enough information is provided, however, to determine if this relative maximum is a global maximum, nor if <m>p</m> happens to have a global minimum at some other point.

              Given <m>p(x) = x^3 - a^2x</m> on <m>[0,a]</m>, we first find the critical number(s) of <m>p</m> that lie in <m>[0,a]</m>.  Since <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a^2 = 3\left(x^2 - \frac{a^2}{3} \right)</m>, we know <m>p</m> has critical numbers at <m>x = \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}</m>.  The negative critical number lies outside the interval, while the positive one lies within the interval since <m>0 \lt \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \lt 1</m>.  Evaluating <m>p</m> at the endpoints and the critical number within the interval, we find that <m>p(0) = 0</m>, <m>p(a) = a^3 - a^2 \cdot a = 0</m>, and <m>p\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^3 - a^2 \cdot \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = \frac{a^3}{3\sqrt{3}} - \frac{a^3}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{2a^3}{3\sqrt{3}}</m>.  Hence, the global maximum of <m>p</m> on <m>[0,a]</m> is <m>p(0) = p(a) = 0</m> and the global minimum is <m>p\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = -\frac{2a^3}{3\sqrt{3}}</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Given <m>r(x) = axe^{-bx}</m> on <m>\left[\frac{1}{2b}, \frac{2}{b}\right]</m>, we first find the critical numbers of <m>r</m> that lie in the given interval.  Note that by the product rule, <m>r'(x) = ax e^{-bx} (-b) + e^{-bx} a</m>.  Factoring, <m>r'(x) = ae^{-bx}(-bx + 1)</m>, and thus the only critical number of <m>r</m> occurs where <m>x = \frac{1}{b}</m>.  Note that <m>\frac{1}{2b} \lt \frac{1}{b} \lt b</m> since <m>b \gt 1</m>, and thus the critical number lies within the interval.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Evaluating <m>r</m> at the endpoints and the critical number, we find 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <m>r\left( \frac{1}{2b} \right) = a \cdot \frac{1}{2b} \cdot e^{-1/2} \approx 0.607 \frac{a}{2b} = 0.3035 \frac{a}{b}</m>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <m>r\left( \frac{2}{b} \right) = a \cdot \frac{2}{b} \cdot e^{-2} \approx 0.135 \frac{2a}{b} = 0.270 \frac{a}{b}</m>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <m>r\left( \frac{1}{b} \right) = a \cdot \frac{1}{b} \cdot e^{-1} \approx 0.368 \frac{a}{b} </m>
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              The global max of <m>r</m> is therefore <m>r\left( \frac{1}{b} \right) \approx 0.368 \frac{a}{b}</m> and the global min is <m>r\left( \frac{2}{b} \right) \approx 0.270 \frac{a}{b}</m>.

            <p>
              For <m>w(x) = a(1-e^{-bx})</m> on <m>[b, 3b]</m>, we first note that <m>w'(x) = a(be^{-bx}) = abe^{-bx}</m>.  Since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both positive and so is <m>e^{-bx}</m> for every value of <m>x</m>, we see that <m>w'(x) \gt 0</m> for every value of <m>x</m>.  Because <m>w</m> is always increasing (specifically on <m>[b,3b]</m>), <m>w</m> has its global minimum at the left endpoint (<m>g(b) = a(1-e^{-b^2})</m>) and its global maximum at the right endpoint (<m>g(3b) = a(1-e^{-3b^2})</m>).

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Finally, for <m>s(x) = \sin(kx)</m> on <m>\left[\frac{\pi}{3k}, \frac{5\pi}{6k}\right]</m>, we know <m>s'(x) = k\cos(kx)</m>, and <m>\cos(kx) = 0</m> when <m>kx = \frac{\pi}{2} \pm n\pi</m> for some integer <m>n</m>, so <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2k} \pm n\pi = \frac{\pi \pm 2n\pi}{2k}</m>.  These <m>x</m>-values are the critical numbers of <m>s</m>.  Note that when <m>n = -1, 0, 1</m>, the corresponding critical numbers are 
              <me>
                x = -\frac{\pi}{2k}, \frac{\pi}{2k}, \frac{3\pi}{2k}
              </me>
              Comparing the values of <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\frac{\pi}{2k}</m>, and <m>\frac{3\pi}{2k}</m> to <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m> and <m>\frac{5\pi}{6}</m>, we see that only <m>\frac{\pi}{2k}</m> lies in the given interval <m>\left[\frac{\pi}{3k}, \frac{5\pi}{6k}\right]</m>, and thus <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2k}</m> is the only critical number at which we need to evaluate <m>s</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Evaluating <m>s</m> at the endpoints and relevant critical number, we find:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <m>s\left( \frac{\pi}{3k} \right) = \sin\left( k \cdot \frac{\pi}{3k} \right) = \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>;
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <m>s\left( \frac{5\pi}{6k} \right) = \sin\left( k \cdot \frac{5\pi}{6k} \right) = \sin\left( \frac{5\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}</m>; and
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <m>s\left( \frac{\pi}{2k} \right) = \sin\left( k \cdot \frac{\pi}{2k} \right) = \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1</m>.

              Hence the global max of <m>s</m> on  <m>\left[\frac{\pi}{3k}, \frac{5\pi}{6k}\right]</m> is <m>s\left( \frac{\pi}{2k} \right) = 1</m> and the global min of <m>s</m> is <m>s\left( \frac{5\pi}{6k} \right) = \frac{1}{2}</m>.

              The fact that <m>f'(x) \leq 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m> means that <m>f</m> cannot increase in this interval. So either <m>f</m> is constant or <m>f</m> decreases somewhere in this interval. We can conclude that the global maximum value of <m>f</m> occurs at <m>x=a</m> and the global minimum value at <m>x=b</m>.

              The information we are given shows that <m>g</m> is increasing on <m>(a,c)</m> and decreasing on <m>(c,b)</m>.  So <m>g</m> has a global maximum value at <m>x=c</m>. We know that <m>g</m> must have a global minimum at either <m>x=a</m> or <m>x=b</m>. The information given does not tell us how much <m>g</m> increases on <m>(a,c)</m> and decreases on <m>(c,b)</m>, so we cannot determine the endpoint at which <m>g</m> attains its global minimum value.

          <li>

              In order for <m>h(a)=h(b)</m> and <m>h''(x) \lt 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>, the graph of <m>h</m> must look something like a parabola that opens down on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Consequently, <m>h</m> has its global minimum at <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m>, and its global maximum somewhere in <m>(a,b)</m>, but we do not know the exact point at which <m>h</m> attains its global maximum.

          <li>
            <p>
              The given information forces the graph of <m>p</m> to decrease on <m>(a,c)</m> then increase on <m>(c,b)</m>. Thus, we must have <m>p(c) \lt p(b)</m> and so <m>p</m> has its global minimum value at <m>x=c</m>.  Since <m>p(a) \gt p(b)</m>, this makes <m>p(a)</m> the global maximum value of <m>p</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>.

              For <m>s(t) = 3\sin(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6})) + 5</m>, <m>s'(t) = 3\cos(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6})) \cdot 2 = 6\cos(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6}))</m>.  It follows that <m>s'(t) = 0</m> if and only if <m>\cos(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6})) = 0</m>, and thus <m>2(t-\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{\pi}{2} \pm k\pi</m> for some integer value of <m>k</m>.  Solving this most recent equation for <m>t</m>, we have <m>t-\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{4} \pm \frac{k\pi}{2}</m>, so
              <me>
                t = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi}{4} \pm \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{12} \pm \frac{k\pi}{2}.
              </me>
              Now we consider the given interval <m>[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}]</m>, which we can think of as <m>[\frac{2\pi}{12}, \frac{14\pi}{12}]</m>.  The value <m>t = \frac{5\pi}{12}</m> lies in this interval, as does <m>t = \frac{5\pi}{12} + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{11\pi}{12}</m>.  Thus, we have two critical numbers in the interval at which to evaluate <m>s</m>, as well as at the endpoints.
