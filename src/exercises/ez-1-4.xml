          <li>
            <p>
              The fact that <m>f</m> is differentiable everywhere means that the graph of <m>f</m> is smooth everywhere.  The slopes of the tangent lines to <m>f</m> are negative but increasing on the interval <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and positive and increasing on the interval <m>(0,\infty)</m>, with a slope of <m>0</m> when <m>x=0</m>. This is the kind of behavior that a quadratic function possesses, so we could guess that <m>f</m> has a graph something like that shown in the figure below.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Because the change in the derivative values is constant, it looks like <m>f'</m> is linear with a slope of <m>1</m>, passing through the point <m>(0,0)</m>, so it is reasonable to guess that <m>f'(x) = x</m>.  A plot of <m>f'</m> is shown at right in the figure below.</p>
            <sidebyside>
              <image width="100%" source="images/1_4_Ez1Soln" />
            </sidebyside>            
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A natural guess is <m>f(x) = x^2</m>; since we need the function to pass through the point <m>(1,-2)</m>, we might try <m>f(x) = x^2 - 3</m>.  Using the limit definition, we have
              <md>
                <mrow>f'(x) &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\left[(x+h)^2-3\right] - \left[x^2-3\right]}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\left[x^2+2xh+h^2-3\right] - \left[x^2-3\right]}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh+h^2}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} 2x+h</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= 2x.</mrow>
              </md> 
              So this guess is close, but is off by a factor of <m>2</m>, since we want <m>f'(x) = x</m>. Instead, if we use <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2-1</m> (note that we chose the ``<m>-1</m>'' so that <m>f(-2)=1</m>, then we have 
              <md>
                <mrow>f'(x) &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\left[\frac{1}{2}(x+h)^2-1\right] - \left[\frac{1}{2}x^2-1\right]}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{2}\left[x^2+2xh+h^2\right] - \frac{1}{2}\left[x^2\right]}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{2}\frac{2xh+h^2}{h}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} x+\frac{h}{2}</mrow>
                <mrow>      &amp;= x.</mrow>
              </md> 
              This appears to be the correct function <m>f</m>.

              In the above figure, we see plots of both <m>g</m> and <m>g'</m>.  We observe that the point <m>(0.5, 2.75)</m> is the vertex of the quadratic function <m>g</m>, and at this point the slope of the tangent line to <m>g(x)</m> is zero.  This aligns with the point <m>(0.5, 0)</m> where <m>y=g'(x)</m> crosses the <m>x</m>-axis.  In addition, we note that <m>g'(x)</m> is negative for <m>x \lt 0.5</m>, which corresponds to where <m>g</m> is decreasing and has tangent lines with slopes that are negative.  Similarly, the values of <m>g'</m> are positive for <m>x \gt 0.5</m>, which align with the values of slopes we see on the original function <m>g</m>.

              For <m>g(x) = x^2 - x + 3</m>, we found that <m>g'(x) = 2x - 1</m>.  For <m>p(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12</m>, we determined that <m>p'(x) = 10x - 4</m>.  The constants <m>3</m> and <m>12</m> don't seem to affect the results at all, and that makes sense because those numbers only serve to shift the graphs of <m>g</m> and <m>p</m> vertically, which does nothing to change the slope.

              The coefficient <m>-4</m> on the linear term in <m>p(x)</m> appears to make the ``<m>-4</m>'' appear in <m>p'(x)= 10x - 4</m>.  That, too, makes sense in light of the fact that if we considered only the linear function <m>L(x) = -4x</m>, the slope would everywhere be <m>-4</m>, in contrast to the coefficent <m>-1</m> found on the linear term in <m>g(x) = x^2 - x + 3</m>, which leads to the constant <m>-1</m> in <m>g'(x) = 2x - 1</m>.

              Finally, the leading coefficient <m>5</m> in <m>(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12</m> leads to the coefficient of ``<m>10</m>'' in <m>p'(x) = 10x -4</m>.  This makes sense because if we considered only <m>y = 5x^2</m>, the <m>5</m> would make the graph <m>5</m> times as steep as the graph of <m>y = x^2</m>, and thus it affects the derivative proportionately.

              Since <m>g'(x)</m> is constant (with value <m>1</m>) on the interval <m>0 \lt x \lt 2</m>, it follows that <m>g</m> is linear on that same interval, since <m>g</m> is increasing at a constant rate.

          <li>
            <p>
              On <m>-3.5 \lt x \lt -2</m>, we also expect <m>g</m> to be linear with slope <m>1</m>, while on <m>-2 \lt x \lt 0</m> and <m>2 \lt x \lt 3.5</m>, <m>g</m> will be linear with slope <m>-1</m>; in each case this is true because the value of <m>g'(x)</m> is constant with the noted value on the interval.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              From the given graph of <m>g'(x)</m>, we observe that <m>g'</m> is undefined at <m>x = -2, 0, 2</m>.  Since we have been given that <m>g</m> is a continuous function, we can conclude that <m>g</m> must have sharp corners on its graph at these points.  Moreover, that makes sense in light of our earlier observations that show <m>g</m> has constant slope on the intervals that connect at <m>x = -2, 0, 2</m> and the graph jumps from having slope <m>1</m> to <m>-1</m>, and then back, and so on.

        For each graph that provides an original function
        <m>y = f(x)</m> in <xref ref="F-1-4-Ez3a">Figure</xref>,
        your task is to sketch an approximate graph of its derivative function,
        <m>y = f'(x)</m>, on the axes immediately below.
        View the scale of the grid for the graph of <m>f</m> as being <m>1 \times 1</m>,
        and assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of <m>f'</m> is identical to that for <m>f</m>.
        If you need to adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graph of <m>f'</m>,
        you should label that accordingly.

      <p>
        At any point where there is a jump in the graph of the derivative, the derivative is undefined.  Normally we would draw an open circle at each end of the graph, but those are omitted here for convenience of plotting.
