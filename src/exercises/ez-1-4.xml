  <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>f</m> be a function with the following properties: <m>f</m> is differentiable at every value of <m>x</m> (that is, <m>f</m> has a derivative at every point), <m>f(-2) = 1</m>, and <m>f'(-2) = -2</m>, <m>f'(-1) = -1</m>, <m>f'(0) = 0</m>, <m>f'(1) = 1</m>, and <m>f'(2) = 2</m>.
    <ol label="a.">
    <li><p>On the axes provided at left in <xref ref="F-1-4-Ez1">Figure</xref>, sketch a possible graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.  Explain why your graph meets the stated criteria.</p></li>
    <li><p>On the axes at right in <xref ref="F-1-4-Ez1">Figure</xref>, sketch a possible graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>.  What type of curve does the provided data suggest for the graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>?</p></li>
    <li><p>Conjecture a formula for the function <m>y = f(x)</m>.  Use the limit definition of the derivative to determine the corresponding formula for <m>y = f'(x)</m>.  Discuss both graphical and algebraic evidence for whether or not your conjecture is correct.</p></li>

  Consider the function <m>g(x) = x^2 - x + 3</m>.

      <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to determine a formula for <m>g'(x)</m>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Use a graphing utility to plot both <m>y = g(x)</m> and your result for <m>y = g'(x)</m>; does your formula for <m>g'(x)</m> generate the graph you expected?</p></li>

  Let <m>g</m> be a continuous function (that is, one with no jumps or holes in the graph) and suppose that a graph of <m>y= g'(x)</m> is given by the graph on the right in <xref ref="F-1-4-Ez2">Figure</xref>.

  <li><p>Observe that for every value of <m>x</m> that satisfies <m>0 \lt  x \lt  2</m>, the value of <m>g'(x)</m> is constant.  What does this tell you about the behavior of the graph of <m>y = g(x)</m> on this interval?</p></li>

<exercise>
<statement>
  <p>
  For each graph that provides an original function <m>y = f(x)</m> in <xref ref="F-1-4-Ez3a">Figure</xref> (on the following page), your task is to sketch an approximate graph of its derivative function, <m>y = f'(x)</m>, on the axes immediately below. View the scale of the grid for the graph of <m>f</m> as being <m>1 \times 1</m>, and assume the horizontal scale of the grid for the graph of <m>f'</m> is identical to that for <m>f</m>. If you need to adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graph of <m>f'</m>, you should label that accordingly.
