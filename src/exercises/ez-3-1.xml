This problem concerns a function about which the following information is known:
<ul>
<li><p><m>f</m> is a differentiable function defined at every real number <m>x</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>f(0) = -1/2</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>y = f'(x)</m> has its graph given at center in <xref ref="F-3-1-Ez1">Figure</xref></p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<figure xml:id="F-3-1-Ez1" >
<caption>At center, a graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>; at left, axes for plotting <m>y = f(x)</m>; at right, axes for plotting <m>y = f''(x)</m>.</caption>
<image width="100%" source="images/3_1_Ez1" />

<p><ol>
<li><p>Construct a first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m>.  Clearly identify all critical numbers of <m>f</m>, where <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing, and where <m>f</m> has local extrema.</p></li>
<li><p>On the right-hand axes, sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f''(x)</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct a second derivative sign chart for <m>f</m>.  Clearly identify where <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down, as well as all inflection points.</p></li>
<li><p>On the left-hand axes, sketch a possible graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.</p></li>

<statement>
<p>
Suppose that <m>g</m> is a differentiable function and <m>g'(2) = 0</m>. In addition, suppose that on <m>1 \lt  x\lt  2</m> and <m>2 \lt  x \lt  3</m> it is known that <m>g'(x)</m> is positive.
<ol>
<li><p>Does <m>g</m> have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at <m>x = 2</m>?  Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that <m>g''(x)</m> exists for every <m>x</m> such that <m>1 \lt  x \lt  3</m>.  Reasoning graphically, describe the behavior of <m>g''(x)</m> for <m>x</m>-values near <m>2</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides being a critical number of <m>g</m>, what is special about the value <m>x = 2</m> in terms of the behavior of the graph of <m>g</m>?</p></li>

Suppose that <m>h</m> is a differentiable function whose first derivative is given by the graph in <xref ref="F-3-1-Ez3">Figure</xref>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="F-3-1-Ez3" >

</figure>
<p><ol>
<li><p>How many real number solutions can the equation <m>h(x) = 0</m> have?  Why?</p></li>
<li><p>If <m>h(x) = 0</m> has two distinct real solutions, what can you say about the signs of the two solutions?  Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} h'(x) = 3</m>, as appears to be indicated in <xref ref="F-3-1-Ez3">Figure</xref>.  How will the graph of <m>y = h(x)</m> appear as <m>x \to \infty</m>?  Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the concavity of <m>y = h(x)</m> as fully as you can from the provided information.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>Construct a second derivative sign chart for <m>p</m> and determine all inflection points of <m>p</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you also know that <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m> is a critical number of <m>p</m>.  Does <m>p</m> have a local minimum, local maximum, or neither at <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m>?  Why?</p></li>
<li><p>If the point <m>(2, \frac{12}{e^2})</m> lies on the graph of <m>y = p(x)</m> and <m>p'(2) = -\frac{5}{e^2}</m>, find the equation of the tangent line to <m>y = p(x)</m> at the point where <m>x = 2</m>.  Does the tangent line lie above the curve, below the curve, or neither at this value?  Why?</p></li>
