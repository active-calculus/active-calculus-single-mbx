              From the given graph of <m>f'</m>,
              the first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m> shows that <m>f</m> has critical numbers at
              <m>x = -1, 1</m> and that <m>f'</m> is positive for
              <m>-1 \lt x lt 1</m> and for <m>x \gt 1</m>,
              while being negative for all <m>x \lt -1</m>.
              Hence <m>f</m> is increasing for
              <m>-1 \lt x lt 1</m> and for <m>x \gt 1</m>,
              and decreasing for <m>x \lt -1</m>.
              It follows by the first derivative test that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m> because <m>f</m> changes from decreasing to increasing there.

              Based on where <m>f'(x)</m> has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative,
              we can sketch an approximate graph of
              <m>y = f''(x)</m> in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function.
              From the given graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
              we can see that <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,
              <m>f''(x)</m> is negative because <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing,
              while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else since <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing everywhere else.
              A possible graph of <m>y = f''(x)</m> is shown at right in the following figure.

              From our sketch of the second derivative in (b),
              we can develop a second derivative sign chart for <m>f</m>.
              In particular, we saw that
              <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,
              <m>f''(x)</m> is negative, while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else.
              This shows that <m>f</m> is concave down for
              <m>-0.35 \lt x \lt 1</m> while being concave up everywhere else.
              We thus see that <m>f</m> has points of inflection at both <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.

              Now that we know where <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing as well as where <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down,
              along with the fact that <m>f(0) = -0.5</m>,
              we can sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.
              Note that we also know <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = 1</m> while being increasing on either side of <m>x = 1</m>,
              and earlier we established that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m>.
              After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through <m>(0,-0.5)</m>,
              we arrive at the graph shown at left below.

              Since <m>h'</m> is negative to the left of <m>0</m> and positive to the right of <m>0</m>,
              the function <m>h</m> is decreasing for <m>x \lt 0</m> and increasing for <m>x \gt 0</m>.
              So <m>h</m> can have at most <m>2</m> real roots (solutions to <m>h(x)=0</m>.
              As the graphs in the following figure show,
              it is possible that <m>h</m> has no real zeros,
              one real zero, or two real zeros.

              the function <m>h</m> has an absolute minimum value at <m>x=0</m>.
              So one root is to the left of this minimum and the other to the right.
              Thus, one root is negative and the other positive.

              We note that <m>h'</m> is increasing everywhere,
              <m>h</m> is concave up everywhere.
              Since the graph of <m>h'</m> levels off for large values of <m>|x|</m>,
              the concavity of <m>h</m> is small when <m>|x|</m> is large.
              Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to <m>h'</m> occurs when <m>x=0</m>,
              so <m>h</m> has its largest second dervitive when <m>x=0</m>.
              So <m>h</m> is almost linear as <m>x</m> decreases without bound,
              <m>h</m> has more bend as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>,
              has its greatest bend at <m>x=0</m>,
              then the second derivative of <m>h</m> as <m>x</m> increases,
              ultimately having <m>h</m> become almost linear as <m>x</m> increases without bound.

              Note that <m>p''(x)=0</m> at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
              The second derivative sign chart for <m>p</m> shows that <m>p''(x)</m> is negative for
              <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m> and positive for all other values of <m>x</m>.

              <m>p</m> has points of inflection at <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 2</m>.
              In particular, <m>p</m> is concave down for

              If we compute <m>p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right)</m>,

              Since <m>p</m> has a horizontal tangent line at this point,

              To determine whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of <m>y=p(x)</m> at <m>x = 2</m>,
              we consider the concavity of <m>p</m>.
              Recall we know that <m>p''(2) = 0</m> and that <m>p</m> is concave down to the left of <m>x = 2</m> and concave up to the right.

              it lies below <m>y = p(x)</m> to the right of <m>x = 2</m> and above
