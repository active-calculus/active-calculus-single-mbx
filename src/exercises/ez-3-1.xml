              From the given graph of <m>f'</m>, the first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m> shows that <m>f</m> has critical numbers at <m>x = -1, 1</m> and that <m>f'</m> is positive for <m>-1 \lt x lt 1</m> and for <m>x \gt 1</m>, while being negative for all <m>x \lt -1</m>.  Hence <m>f</m> is increasing for <m>-1 \lt x lt 1</m> and for <m>x \gt 1</m>, and decreasing for <m>x \lt -1</m>.  It follows by the first derivative test that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m> because <m>f</m> changes from decreasing to increasing there.

            <p>
              Based on where <m>f'(x)</m> has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative, we can sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f''(x)</m> in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function.  From the given graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>, we can see that <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>, and that between these points, <m>f''(x)</m> is negative because <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing, while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else since <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing everywhere else.  A possible graph of <m>y = f''(x)</m> is shown at right in the following figure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              From our sketch of the second derivative in (b), we can develop a second derivative sign chart for <m>f</m>.  In particular, we saw that <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>, and that between these points, <m>f''(x)</m> is negative, while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else.  This shows that <m>f</m> is concave down for <m>-0.35 \lt x \lt 1</m> while being concave up everywhere else.  We thus see that <m>f</m> has points of inflection at both <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now that we know where <m>f</m> is increasing and decreasing as well as where <m>f</m> is concave up and concave down, along with the fact that <m>f(0) = -0.5</m>, we can sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.  Note that we also know <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = 1</m> while being increasing on either side of <m>x = 1</m>, and earlier we established that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m>.  After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through <m>(0,-0.5)</m>, we arrive at the graph shown at left below.

              Since <m>h'</m> is negative to the left of <m>0</m> and positive to the right of <m>0</m>, the function <m>h</m> is decreasing for <m>x \lt 0</m> and increasing for <m>x \gt 0</m>. So <m>h</m> can have at most <m>2</m> real roots (solutions to <m>h(x)=0</m>. As the graphs in the following figure show, it is possible that <m>h</m> has no real zeros, one real zero, or two real zeros.

              Given that <m>h</m> is decreasing for <m>x \lt 0</m> and increasing for <m>x \gt 0</m>, the function <m>h</m> has an absolute minimum value at <m>x=0</m>. So one root is to the left of this minimum and the other to the right. Thus, one root is negative and the other positive.  See, for instance, the lowest of the three possibilities for <m>h</m> shown in the figure in (a).

              The slopes of the tangent lines to <m>h</m> will all be near <m>3</m>, but less than <m>3</m>, as <m>x</m> gets large. So the graph of <m>h</m> will look very much like a line with slope <m>3</m> for large values of <m>x</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              We note that <m>h'</m> is increasing everywhere, <m>h</m> is concave up everywhere. Since the graph of <m>h'</m> levels off for large values of <m>|x|</m>, the concavity of <m>h</m> is small when <m>|x|</m> is large. Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to <m>h'</m> occurs when <m>x=0</m>, so <m>h</m> has its largest second dervitive when <m>x=0</m>. So <m>h</m> is almost linear as <m>x</m> decreases without bound, <m>h</m> has more bend as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>, has its greatest bend at <m>x=0</m>, then the second derivative of <m>h</m> as <m>x</m> increases, ultimately having <m>h</m> become almost linear as <m>x</m> increases without bound.

              Suppose you also know that
              <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m> is a critical number of <m>p</m>.
              Does <m>p</m> have a local minimum,
              local maximum, or neither at <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m>?
              Why?

              If the point <m>(2, \frac{12}{e^2})</m> lies on the graph of
              <m>y = p(x)</m> and <m>p'(2) = -\frac{5}{e^2}</m>,
              find the equation of the tangent line to
              <m>y = p(x)</m> at the point where <m>x = 2</m>.
              Does the tangent line lie above the curve,
              below the curve, or neither at this value?
              Why?

              Note that <m>p''(x)=0</m> at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.  The second derivative sign chart for <m>p</m> shows that <m>p''(x)</m> is negative for <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m> and positive for all other values of <m>x</m>.  Since <m>p''</m> changes sign at <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 2</m>, <m>p</m> has points of inflection at <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 2</m>.  In particular,  <m>p</m> is concave down for <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m> and concave up for all other values of <m>x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we compute <m>p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right)</m>, we find that <m>p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right) \approx -1.205</m>, which means that <m>p</m> is concave down at <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m>.  Since <m>p</m> has a horizontal tangent line at this point, it follows that <m>p</m> has a local maximum at <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m> by the second derivative test.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>p(2) = \frac{12}{e^2}</m> and <m>p'(2) = -\frac{5}{e^2}</m>, the equation of the tangent line to <m>p</m> at <m>x = 2</m> is given by <m>y = -\frac{5}{e^2}(x-2) + \frac{12}{e^2}</m>.  To determine whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of <m>y=p(x)</m> at <m>x = 2</m>, we consider the concavity of <m>p</m>.  Recall we know that <m>p''(2) = 0</m> and that <m>p</m> is concave down to the left of <m>x = 2</m> and concave up to the right.  Thus, the tangent line lies neither solely below nor solely above the graph of <m>y = p(x)</m> at <m>x = 2</m>; it lies below <m>y = p(x)</m> to the right of <m>x = 2</m> and above <m>y = p(x)</m> to the left of <m>x = 2</m>.
