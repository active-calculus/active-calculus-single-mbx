This problem concerns a function about which the following information is known:

<li><p><m>f</m> is a differentiable function defined at every real number <m>x</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>f(0) = -1/2</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>y = f'(x)</m> has its graph given at center in <xref ref="F-3-1-Ez1">Figure</xref></p></li>
</ul>

<caption>At center, a graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>; at left, axes for plotting <m>y = f(x)</m>; at right, axes for plotting <m>y = f''(x)</m>.</caption>

<statement>
<p>
Suppose that <m>g</m> is a differentiable function and <m>g'(2) = 0</m>. In addition, suppose that on <m>1 \lt  x\lt  2</m> and <m>2 \lt  x \lt  3</m> it is known that <m>g'(x)</m> is positive.
<ol label="a.">
<li><p>Does <m>g</m> have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at <m>x = 2</m>?  Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that <m>g''(x)</m> exists for every <m>x</m> such that <m>1 \lt  x \lt  3</m>.  Reasoning graphically, describe the behavior of <m>g''(x)</m> for <m>x</m>-values near <m>2</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides being a critical number of <m>g</m>, what is special about the value <m>x = 2</m> in terms of the behavior of the graph of <m>g</m>?</p></li>
