          <li>
            <p>
              From the given graph of <m>g'</m>, we may estimate that <m>g'(2) \approx 1.4</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Observe that <m>g'</m> is always positive.  This tells us that <m>g</m> must be always increasing.  Therefore, it follows that <m>g</m> may cross the <m>x</m>-axis at most one time, and hence there can be at most one solution to <m>g(x) = 0</m>.

            <p>
              On <m>-3 \lt x \lt 3</m>, <m>g</m> changes concavity <m>g</m> times, since <m>g'</m> changes from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing <m>9</m> times.  Whenever <m>g'</m> is increasing, <m>g''</m> is positive, and whenever <m>g'</m> is decreasing, <m>g''</m> is negative.  Hence, whenever <m>g'</m> changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it follows that <m>g''</m> changes sign, and this causes a change in the concavity of <m>g</m>.  We therefore see that while <m>g</m> is always increasing, <m>g</m> changes concavity many times.

              <me>

              We again use a central difference, this time to estimate <m>h''(5)</m>.  Observe that 
              <me>
                h''(5) \approx \frac{h'(5.5) - h'(4.5)}{5.5-4.5} = \frac{23.9 - 14.3}{1} = 9.6

              <m>h''(5)</m> measures the acceleration of the bungee jumper at <m>t = 5</m>.  Thus we know that the person's acceleration at <m>t = 5</m> is about <m>9.6</m> feet per second per second.  This measures the instantaneous rate of change of the jumper's velocity.

              The bungee jumper's position function is concave down on approximately the intervals <m>0 \lt t \lt 2</m>, <m>6 \lt t \lt 10</m>.  This is easiest to see if we plot the data using a program like Excel.  On these time intervals, the velocity of the jumper is decreasing:  either the velocity is positive and getting less positive, or negative and getting more negative.

              When a function is increasing, its graph rises as <m>x</m> increases, and when a function is concave up, that means the graph of the function looks bowl-shaped. A graph of an increasing, concave up function <m>f</m> on the interval <m>(-3,0)</m> is shown in the following figure. When a function is concave down, its graph looks like an upside down bowl. The function <m>f</m> in the figure is increasing and concave down on the interval <m>(0,3)</m> Note that <m>f</m> is also increasing on the entire interval <m>(-3,3)</m>.

              When a function is decreasing, its graph falls as <m>x</m> increases, and when a function is concave up, that means the graph of the function looks bowl-shaped. A graph of a decreasing, concave up function <m>h</m> on the interval <m>(-3,-1)</m>is shown in the figure below. To be neither concave up or concave down, a graph has to be linear, so the graph of <m>h</m> in the following figure is a straight line on <m>(-1,1)</m>. When a function is concave down, its graph looks like an upside down bowl. The function <m>h</m> in the figure is decreasing and concave down on the interval <m>(1,3)</m>. Note that <m>h</m> is decreasing on the entire interval <m>(-3,3)</m>.
