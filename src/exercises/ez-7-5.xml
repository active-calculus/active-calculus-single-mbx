        Congratulations, you just won the lottery!
        In one option
        presented to you, you will be paid one million dollars a year for
        the next 25 years.
        You can deposit this money in an account that
        will earn 5<percent /> each year.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Set up a differential equation that describes the rate of
              change in the amount of money in the account.
              Two factors cause
              the amount to grow<mdash />first,
              you are depositing one millon dollars
              per year and second,
              you are earning 5<percent /> interest.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If there is no amount of money in the account when you open it,
              how much money will you have in the account after 25 years?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The second option presented to you is to take a lump sum of 10 million dollars,
              which you will deposit into a similar account.
              How much money will you have in that account after 25 years?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Do you prefer the first or second option?
              Explain your thinking.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              At what time does the amount of money in the account under the first option overtake the amount of money in the account under the second option?

        When a skydiver jumps from a plane, gravity causes
        her downward velocity to increase at the rate of <m>g\approx 9.8</m>
        meters per second squared.
        At the same time, wind resistance
        causes her velocity to decrease at a rate proportional to the
        velocity.

          <li>
            <p>

        Suppose that you have a water tank that holds 100 gallons of water.
        A briny solution, which contains 20 grams of salt per gallon,
        enters the tank at the rate of 3 gallons per minute.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, the solution is well mixed, and water is pumped
        out of the tank at the rate of 3 gallons per minute.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Since 3 gallons enters the tank every minute and 3 gallons leaves every minute,
              what can you conclude about the volume of water in the tank.

              How many grams of salt enters the tank every minute?

              Suppose that <m>S(t)</m> denotes the number of grams of salt in the tank in minute <m>t</m>.
              How many grams are there in each gallon in minute <m>t</m>?

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Since water leaves the tank at 3 gallons per minute,
              how many grams of salt leave the tank each minute?

            <p>
              Suppose that there is initially no salt in the tank.
