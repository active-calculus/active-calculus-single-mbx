        Congratulations, you just won the lottery!
        In one option
        presented to you, you will be paid one million dollars a year for
        the next 25 years.
        You can deposit this money in an account that
        will earn 5<percent /> each year.
        <ol label="a.">

              Set up a differential equation that describes the rate of

              Two factors cause
              the amount to grow<mdash />first,
              you are depositing one millon dollars

          <li>
            <p>
              The second option presented to you is to take a lump sum of 10 million dollars,

          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>A(t)</m> be the amount of money (in millions) in the account at time <m>t</m>.  We know that the rate of change of <m>A</m> is affected by the addition of <m>1</m> million dollars a year, plus the interest earned, which is <m>0.05A</m>.  Thus,
              <me>
                \frac{dA}{dt} = 1 + 0.05A
              </me>

          <li>
            <p>
              If there is no amount of money in the account when you open it, that means <m>A(0) = 0</m>.  Solving the initial value problem, we can find 
              how much money will be in the account after 25 years.  Note that <m>1 + 0.05A = 0.05(20 + A)</m>, so we have 
              <me>
                \frac{1}{20+A} \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05
              </me>
              and thus
              <me>
                \int \frac{1}{20+A} \, dA = \int 0.05 \, dt
              </me>.
              Integrating (and noting that <m>A(t) > 0</m> for all <m>t</m>,
              <me>
                \ln (20 + A) = 0.05t + C
              </me>,
              so solving for <m>A</m> in the standard way,
              <me>
                20 + A = Ke^{0.05t}
              </me>
              and thus <m>A(t) = Ke^{0.05t} - 20</m>.  Since <m>A(0) = 0</m>, <m>K = 20</m>, and we've shown
              <me>
                A(t) = 20(e^{0.05t} - 1)
              </me>.
              It follows that <m>A(25) = 49.80686</m> million dollars.

          <li>
            <p>
              For this option, we know that <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A</m>, <m>A(0) = 10</m>, and thus by the standard solution to this IVP,
              <me>
                A(t) = 10e^{0.05t}
              </me>
              from which we see that <m>A(25) = 34.90343</m> million dollars.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The first option is obviously better because it leads to more money in the long term.

          <li>
            <p>
              The amount of money in the account under the first option overtakes the amount of money in the account under the second option when <m>20(e^{0.05t} - 1) = 10e^{0.05t}</m>.  Solving for <m>t</m>, we find that <m>10e^{0.05t} = 20</m>, so <m>e^{0.05t} = 2</m>, and thus
              <me>
                t = 20 \ln(2) \approx 13.86 \ \text{years}

        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Let the skydiver's downward velocity at time <m>t</m> be given by <m>v(t)</m>. Since gravity causes her downward velocity to increase at the rate of <m>g\approx 9.8</m>, there is a factor of <m>+9.8</m> meters per second squared in the differential equation for <m>\frac{dv}{dt}</m>, while the factor of wind resistence causing the velocity to decrease contributes the negative factor <m>-kv</m>.  Thus, the differential equation is
              <me>
                \frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - kv
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              To find the equilibrium solutions, we set <m>\frac{dv}{dt} = 0</m> and solve for <m>v</m>. Doing so, <m>0 = 9.8 - kv</m>, so <m>v = \frac{9.8}{k}</m>.  Moreover, we note that for <m>v \lt \frac{9.8}{k}</m>, <m>\frac{dv}{dt} \gt 0</m>, while for <m>\frac{dv}{dt} \gt \frac{9.8}{k}</m>, <m>\frac{dv}{dt} \lt 0</m>.  Thus, for velocities just above the equilibrium, the velocity will decrease and for velocities just below the equilibrium, the velocity will decrease, making <m>v = \frac{9.8}{k}</m> a stable equilibrium.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We assume that <m>v(0) = 0</m> and solve the IVP with the differential equation we developed.
              Taking the differential equation 
              <me>
                \frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - kv
              </me>
              and separating the variables, we have
              <me>
                \frac{1}{9.8 - kv} \frac{dv}{dt} = 1
              </me>.
              Integrating with respect to <m>t</m>,
              <me>
                \int \frac{1}{9.8 - kv} \, dv = \int 1 \, dt
              </me>,
              and using a standard substitution, we have
              <me>
                -\frac{1}{k} \ln | 9.8 - kv | = t + C
              </me>.
              Solving for <m>v</m>, we have <m>\ln | 9.8 - kv | = -kt + C_1</m> (where <m>C_1 = -Ck</m>, or
              <me>
                |9.8 - kv| = e^{-kt + C_1} = C_2 e^{-kt}
              </me>.
              Incorporating the absolute value into the constant <m>C_2</m> in the usual way, we have for some constant <m>A</m> that 
              <me>
                9.8 - kv = Ae^{-kt}
              </me>
              and thus
              <me>
                v = \frac{9.8 - Ae^{-kt}}{k}
              </me>.
              Setting <m>v(0) = 0</m>, we can also determine <m>A</m>, since then 
              <me>
                0 = \frac{9.8 - A}{k}
              </me>
              so <m>A = 9.8</m>.  The solution to the IVP is therefore
              <me>
                v(t) = \frac{9.8 - 9.8e^{-kt}}{k}
              </me>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the skydiver's terminal velocity is 54 meters per second, this means that 
              <me>
                \lim_{t \to \infty} v(t) = 54
              </me>
              Using the solution we found in (c), we observe that 
              <me>
                \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{9.8 - 9.8e^{-kt}}{k} = \frac{9.8}{k}
              </me>
              since <m>e^{-kt} \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>.  Thus, <m>54 = \frac{9.8}{k}</m>, so <m>k = 9.8/54 \approx 0.181481</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              To find how long does it take to reach 50<percent /> of the terminal
              velocity, we set <m>v(t) = \frac{9.8 - 9.8e^{-0.181481t}}{0.181481} = 0.5(54)</m> and solve for <m>t</m>.  We have
              <me>
                9.8 - 9.8e^{-0.181481t} = 0.5(54)(0.181481)
              </me>,
              so
              <me>
                9.8-9.8e^{-0.181481t} = 4.9
              </me>,
              and thus <m>9.8e^{-0.181481t} = 4.9</m>, which tells us 
              <me>
                e^{-0.181481t} = 0.5
              </me>.
              Solving for <m>t</m>, <m>t = \frac{\ln(0.5)}{-0.181481} \approx 3.1894</m> seconds.

          <li>
            <p>
              Since the baby's weight, <m>w(t)</m> (in pounds at month <m>t</m>), grows at a rate proportional to its reciprocal, we have
              <me>
                \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{k}{w}
              </me>.

            <p>
              Given that <m>W(0) = 8</m> and <m>W(1) = 9</m>, we can both solve the IVP and determine <m>k</m>.  To start, we separate variables and solve the differential equation by writing
              <me>
                w \frac{dw}{dt} = k
              </me>
              and integrating to get 
              <me>
                \int w \frac{dw}{dt} \, dt = \int k \, dt
              </me>.
              It follows that 
              <me>
                \frac{1}{2}w^2 = kt + C
              </me>
              and therefore <m>w(t) = \sqrt{2kt + C_1}</m> (where <m>C_1 = 2C</m> and we take the positive square root because we know <m>w(t) \gt 0</m>).  Applying the initial condition <m>w(0) = 0</m>, we find that <m>8 = \sqrt{C_1}</m>, so <m>C_1 = 64</m> and
              <me>
                w(t) = \sqrt{2kt + 64}
              </me>.
              To find <m>k</m>, we use the additional information that <m>w(1) = 9</m>, so 
              <me>
                9 = \sqrt{2k + 64}
              </me>
              which implies that <m>81 = 2k + 64</m> and thus <m>k = 17/2</m>.  Thus,
              <me>
                w(t) = \sqrt{7t+64}
              </me>.  At one year, according to the model the baby weighs <m>w(12) = \sqrt{148} \approx 12.17</m> pounds.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              While the function <m>w(t) = \sqrt{7t+64}</m> grows without bound as <m>t</m> increases, the model is unrealistic more because the function initially doesn't grow fast enough.  For example, the model predicts that at age <m>10</m>, <m>w(120) \approx 30.06</m> pounds, and at age <m>20</m>, <m>w(120) = 41.76</m> pounds.  A realistic model would need to grow much more quickly early in life and then level off around age <m>20</m>.

              Salt enters the tank with the inflow, which occurs at a rate of <m>3</m> gallons per minute at a concentration of <m>20</m> grams per gallon.  Observing that

                20 \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{gallon}} \cdot 3 \frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{minute}} = 60 \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{minute}}

              Letting <m>S(t)</m> denotes the number of grams of salt in the tank at time <m>t</m>, since there are <m>100</m> gallons of solution in the tank at any time <m>t</m>, the concentration of salt in the tank in grams per gallon is

                \frac{S(t)}{100} \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{gallon}}

              With water leaving the tank at <m>3</m> gallons per minute,
              it follows that salt is leaving the tank at a rate of 
              <me>
                \frac{S(t)}{100} \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{gallon}} \cdot 3 \frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{minute}} = \frac{3S(t)}{100} \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{minute}}

              Taking into account the rates at which salt enters and leaves the tank as established in (b) and (d) and noting that the units on <m>\frac{dS}{dt}</m> are grams per minute, we have shown that
              <me>
                \frac{dS}{dt} = 60 - \frac{3}{100} S

          <li>
            <p>
              Setting <m>60 - \frac{3}{100} S = 0</m>, we find that <m>S = 2000</m> is the only equilibrium solution.  This makes sense because the inflow is carrying <m>20</m> grams of salt per gallon and thus when the tank reaches this concentration, there will be <m>20 \cdot 100</m> total grams of salt.  This equilibrium is stable (both intuitively and because <m>\frac{dS}{dt}</m> is positive for <m>S \lt 2000</m> and negative for <m>S \gt 2000</m>.

              Assuming that <m>S(0) = 0</m>, we can solve the IVP with <m>\frac{dS}{dt} = 60 - \frac{3}{100} S</m>.  For somewhat simpler computations, we write <m>60 - \frac{3}{100}S = -\frac{3}{100}(S-2000)</m>.  Separating variables,
              <me>
                \frac{1}{S-2000} \frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{3}{100}
              </me>
              and integrating with respect to <m>t</m>,
              <me>
                \int  \frac{1}{S-2000} \, dS = -\int \frac{3}{100} \, dt
              </me>
              so that
              <me>
                \ln|S-2000| = -\frac{3}{100}t + C    
              </me>.
              Solving for <m>S</m> in the usual way,
              <me>
                S = 2000 + Ke^{-\frac{3}{100}t}
              </me>
              and using the initial condition that <m>S(0) = 0</m>, we find <m>K = -2000</m> so that 
              <me>
                S(t) = 2000 - 2000e^{-\frac{3}{100}t}

          <li>
            <p>
              As <m>t \to \infty</m>, we know <m>e^{-\frac{3}{100}t} \to 0</m>, and thus <m>S(t) \to 2000</m>.  This makes sense because the inflow carries <m>20</m> grams of salt per liter continuously.  As time goes on, the concentration of solution in the tank should tend to that same concentration, and with <m>100</m> gallons of solution, the amount of salt will tend to <m>20 \cdot 100 = 2000</m> grams.  This value also matches the stable equilibrium that we found in (f).
