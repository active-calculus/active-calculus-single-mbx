    <statement>
      <p>
        There is an old question that is often used to introduce the power of geometric growth.
        Here is one version.
        Suppose you are hired for a one month (30 days,
        working every day) job and are given two options to be paid.
      </p>

      <p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Option 1.</title>
            <p>
              You can be paid <dollar />500 per day or
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Option 2.</title>
            <p>
              You can be paid 1 cent the first day, 2 cents the second day, 4 cents the third day, 8 cents the fourth day,
              and so on, doubling the amount you are paid each day.
            </p>

              So on day 30 under Option 2 the total payment will be
              <me>
                \dollar0.01\left(2^{30}-1\right) = \dollar10,737,418.23
              </me>,
              so Option 2 is definitely the better deal.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you drop a golf ball onto a hard surface from a height <m>h</m>.
        The collision with the ground causes the ball to lose energy and so it will not bounce back to its original height.
        The ball will then fall again to the ground,
        bounce back up, and continue.
        Assume that at each bounce the ball rises back to a height
        <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> of the height from which it dropped.
        Let <m>h_n</m> be the height of the ball on the <m>n</m>th bounce,
        with <m>h_0 = h</m>.
        In this exercise we will determine the distance traveled by the ball and the time it takes to travel that distance.

        Suppose you play a game with a friend that involves rolling a standard six-sided die.
        Before a player can participate in the game,

              which is a geometric series with <m>a = \frac{1}{6}</m> and <m>r = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2</m>.  Since we know that a geometric series has sum <m>S = \frac{a}{1-r}</m>, it follows that

    <statement>
      <p>
        The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy.
        Economists and politicians quote numbers like
        <q><m>k</m> million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of <m>n</m> billion of dollars.</q>
        Where do they get these numbers?
        Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts.
        Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate.
        For example,
        assume that for a typical person, 75<percent /> of her entire income is spent (that is,
        put back into the economy).
        Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals <m>P</m> dollars for each person.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              The tax cut of <m>P</m> dollars is income for its recipient.
              How much of this tax cut will be spent?
            </p>
          </li>

              In this simple model,
              we will say that the spent portion of the tax cut/rebate from part (a) then becomes income for another person who, in turn,
              spends 75<percent /> of this income.
              After this ``second round" of spent income,
              how many total dollars have been added to the economy as a result of the original tax cut/rebate?

          <li>

              This second round of spending becomes income for another group who spend 75<percent /> of this income,

              In economics this is called the
              <em>multiplier effect</em>.

        Like stimulus packages,
        home mortgages and foreclosures also impact the economy.
        A problem for many borrowers is the adjustable rate mortgage,
        in which the interest rate can change
        (and usually increases)
        over the duration of the loan,
        causing the monthly payments to increase beyond the ability of the borrower to pay.
        Most financial analysts recommend fixed rate loans,
        ones for which the monthly payments remain constant throughout the term of the loan.
        In this exercise we will analyze fixed rate loans.
      </p>

      <p>
        When most people buy a large ticket item like car or a house,
        they have to take out a loan to make the purchase.
        The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan,
        plus interest, is paid.
        With a loan, we borrow money, say <m>P</m> dollars
        (called the principal),
        and pay off the loan at an interest rate of <m>r</m><percent />.
        To pay back the loan we make regular monthly payments,
        some of which goes to pay off the principal and some of which is charged as interest.
        In most cases,
        the interest is computed based on the amount of principal that remains at the beginning of the month.
        We assume a fixed rate loan,
        that is one in which we make a constant monthly payment <m>M</m> on our loan,
        beginning in the original month of the loan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose you want to buy a house.
        You have a certain amount of money saved to make a down payment,
        and you will borrow the rest to pay for the house.
        Of course, for the privilege of loaning you the money,
        the bank will charge you interest on this loan,
        so the amount you pay back to the bank is more than the amount you borrow.
        In fact, the amount you ultimately pay depends on three things:
        the amount you borrow
        (called the <em>principal</em>),
        the interest rate,
        and the length of time you have to pay off the loan plus interest (called the
        <em>duration</em> of the loan).
        For this example,
        we assume that the interest rate is fixed at <m>r</m><percent />.
      </p>

      <p>
        To pay off the loan,
        each month you make a payment of the same amount (called <em>installments</em>).
        Suppose we borrow <m>P</m> dollars
        (our principal)
        and pay off the loan at an interest rate of <m>r</m><percent /> with regular monthly installment payments of <m>M</m> dollars.
        So in month 1 of the loan,
        before we make any payments,
        our principal is <m>P</m> dollars.
        Our goal in this exercise is to find a formula that relates these three parameters to the time duration of the loan.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are charged interest every month at an annual rate of <m>r</m><percent />, so each month we pay
        <m>\frac{r}{12}</m><percent /> interest on the principal that remains.
        Given that the original principal is <m>P</m> dollars,
        we will pay <m>\left(\frac{0.0r}{12}\right)P</m> dollars in interest on our first payment.
        Since we paid <m>M</m> dollars in total for our first payment,
        the remainder of the payment (<m>M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P</m>) goes to pay down the principal.
        So the principal remaining after the first payment (let's call it <m>P_1</m>) is the original principal minus what we paid on the principal, or
        <me>
          P_1 = P - \left( M - \left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P\right) = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P - M
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as <m>P_1</m> is positive,
        we still have to keep making payments to pay off the loan.

            If we continue in the manner described in the problems above,

            </men>.
            This is a rather complicated formula and one that is difficult to use.
            However,
            we can simplify the sum if we recognize part of  it as a partial sum of a geometric series.
            Find a formula for the sum

            and then a general formula for <m>P_n</m> that does not involve a sum.

        <li>
          <p>
            It is usually more convenient to write our formula for <m>P_n</m> in terms of years rather than months.
            Show that <m>P(t)</m>,
            the principal remaining after <m>t</m> years, can be written as

            Now that we have analyzed the general loan situation,
            we apply formula <xref ref="eq-loan2" /> to an actual loan.
            Suppose we charge <dollar />1,000 on a credit card for holiday expenses.
            If our credit card charges 20<percent /> interest and we pay only the minimum payment of <dollar />25 each month,
            how long will it take us to pay off the <dollar />1,000 charge?
            How much in total will we have paid on this <dollar />1,000 charge?
            How much total interest will we pay on this loan?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now we consider larger loans,
            e.g., automobile loans or mortgages,
            in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time.
            In this situation,
            we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time.
            In this situation,
            we need to find the monthly payment <m>M</m> that will take our outstanding principal to <m>0</m> in the specified amount of time.
            To do so, we want to know the value of <m>M</m> that makes
            <m>P(t) = 0</m> in formula<nbsp /><xref ref="eq-loan2" />.
            If we set <m>P(t) = 0</m> and solve for <m>M</m>,
            it follows that
            <me>
              M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}

              So formula <xref ref="eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric" /> shows that the partial sum <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k</m> is equal to
              <md>
                <mrow>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k \amp = \frac{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n}{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = \left(\frac{12}{r}\right) \left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - 1\right)</mrow>

              Now we can determine that the remaining principal after <m>n</m> installments is
              <md>
                <mrow>P_n \amp = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^nP - \left[\left(\frac{12}{r}\right) \left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - 1\right) \right] M</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = P \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - \left(\frac{12M}{r}\right) \left( \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - 1\right)</mrow>

              To put our payments into a yearly context which is more convenient,
              we know that there are <m>12t</m> months in <m>t</m> years.
              So we can say that the principal <m>P(t)</m> remaining at the end of <m>t</m> years is
              <men xml:id="eq-loan1">
                P(t) = P \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - \left(\frac{12M}{r}\right) \left( \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1\right)
              </men>
              which reduces to <xref ref="eq-loan2" />.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Under these conditions,
              the principal in the account at the end of <m>t</m> years will be
              <me>
                A(t) = \left(1000 - \frac{12(25)}{0.2}\right)\left(1+\frac{0.2}{12}\right)^{12t} + \frac{12(25)}{0.2}
              </me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              To determine how long it will take us to pay off the card,
              we need to find the time so that <m>A(t) = 0</m>.
              When <m>A(t) = 0</m> we have
              <md>
                <mrow>0 \amp = \left(1000 - \frac{12(25)}{0.2}\right)\left(1+\frac{0.2}{12}\right)^{12t} + \frac{12(25)}{0.2}</mrow>
                <mrow>0 \amp = (-500)(1.0167)^{12t} + 1500</mrow>
                <mrow>500(1.0167)^{12t} \amp = 1500</mrow>
                <mrow>(1.0167)^{12t} \amp = 3</mrow>
                <mrow>12t \ln(1.0167) \amp = \ln(3)</mrow>
                <mrow>t \amp = \frac{\ln(3)}{12 \ln(1.0167)}</mrow>
                <mrow>t \amp \approx 5.53</mrow>
              </md>.

            <p>
              So it would take over 5.5 years to pay off the debt.
              At <dollar />25 per month,
              we will have paid approximately
              <m>12 \times 5.5 \times 25 = 1{,}659</m> dollars on our original <dollar />1,000 charge.
              In other words,
              we pay <dollar />659 dollars in interest on our <dollar />1000 loan.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We need to find the value of <m>M</m> in our formula:
              <me>
                M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)} = \frac{(0.0625)(15000)\left(1+\frac{0.0625}{12}\right)^{60}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{0.0625}{12}\right)^{60} - 1 \right)} \approx 291.74
              </me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              So we need to pay <dollar />291.74 each month to complete the loan in 5 years.
              During that time we spend a total of
              <m>12 \times 5 \times 291.74 = 17{,}504.40</m> dollars on the loan or <dollar />2,504.40 in interest.
