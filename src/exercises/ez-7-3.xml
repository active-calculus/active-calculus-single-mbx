        Newton's Law of Cooling says that the rate at which an
        object, such as a cup of coffee,
        cools is proportional to the
        difference in the object's temperature and room temperature.
        If
        <m>T(t)</m> is the object's temperature and <m>T_r</m> is room temperature,
        this law is expressed at
        <me>
          \frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-T_r)
        </me>,
        where <m>k</m> is a constant of proportionality.
        In this problem,
        temperature is
        measured in degrees Fahrenheit and time in minutes.

              Two calculus students, Alice and Bob,

              The differential equation for Alice has a constant of proportionality <m>k=0.5</m>,

    <statement>
      <p>
        We have seen that the error in approximating the solution to
        an initial value problem is proportional to <m>\Delta t</m>.
        That is,
        if <m>E_{\Delta t}</m> is the Euler's method approximation to the
        solution to an initial value problem at <m>\overline{t}</m>, then
        <me>
          y(\overline{t})-E_{\Delta t} \approx K\Delta t
        </me>
        for some constant of proportionality <m>K</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this problem, we will see how to use this fact to improve our
        estimates, using an idea called
        <em>accelerated convergence</em>.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              We will create a new approximation by assuming the error is
              <em>exactly</em>
              proportional to <m>\Delta t</m>, according to the formula
              <me>
                y(\overline{t})-E_{\Delta t} =K\Delta t
              </me>.
              Using our earlier results from the initial value problem <m>dy/dt = y</m> and
              <m>y(0)=1</m> with
              <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m> and <m>\Delta t = 0.1</m>, we have
              <md>
                <mrow>y(1) - 2.4883 =\mathstrut \amp  0.2K</mrow>
                <mrow>y(1) - 2.5937 =\mathstrut \amp  0.1K</mrow>
              </md>.
              This is a system of two linear equations in the unknowns <m>y(1)</m>
              and <m>K</m>.
              Solve this system to find a new approximation for
              <m>y(1)</m>.  (You may remember that the exact value is <m>y(1) = e =
              2.71828\ldots</m>.)

          <li>
            <p>
              Use the other data, <m>E_{0.05} = 2.6533</m> and
              <m>E_{0.025} = 2.6851</m> to do similar work as in (a) to obtain another approximation.
              Which gives the better approximation?
              Why do you think this is?

          <li>
            <p>
              Let's now study the initial value problem
              <me>
                \frac{dy}{dt} = t-y, \ y(0) = 0
              </me>.
              Approximate <m>y(0.3)</m> by applying Euler's method to find
              approximations <m>E_{0.1}</m> and <m>E_{0.05}</m>.
              Now use the idea of
              accelerated convergence to obtain a better approximation.  (For the sake of comparison,
              you want to  note that the actual value is <m>y(0.3) =
              0.0408</m>.)

    <statement>
      <p>
        In this problem,
        we'll modify Euler's method to obtain better approximations to solutions of initial value problems.
        This method is called the <em>Improved Euler's method.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In Euler's method, we walk across an interval of width
        <m>\Delta t</m> using the slope obtained from the differential equation at the left endpoint of the interval.
        Of course, the slope of the solution will most likely change over this interval.
        We can improve our approximation by trying to incorporate the change in the slope over the interval.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's again consider the initial value problem <m>dy/dt = y</m> and <m>y(0) = 1</m>,
        which we will approximate using steps of width <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m>.
        Our first interval is therefore <m>0\leq t \leq 0.2</m>.
        At <m>t=0</m>,
        the differential equation tells us that the slope is 1, and the approximation we obtain from Euler's method is that <m>y(0.2)\approx y_1= 1+ 1(0.2)= 1.2</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This gives us some idea for how the slope has changed over the interval <m>0\leq t\leq 0.2</m>.
        We know the slope at <m>t=0</m> is 1, while the slope at <m>t=0.2</m> is 1.2, trusting in the Euler's method approximation.
        We will therefore refine our estimate of the initial slope to be the average of these two slopes;
        that is, we will estimate the slope to be <m>(1+1.2)/2 = 1.1</m>.
        This gives the new approximation <m>y(1) = y_1 = 1 + 1.1(0.2) = 1.22</m>.
