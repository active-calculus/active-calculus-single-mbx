    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>V(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t + 6 \sin(t)</m> represents the value of a person's investment portfolio in thousands of dollars in year <m>t</m>,

        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              January 1, 2012 corresponds to the instant <m>t = 2</m>, so we compute <m>V'(2)</m>.  First, we observe by the sum and constant multiple rules that <m>V'(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(t)</m>.  Thus, <m>V'(2) = 24 \cdot 1.07^2 \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(2) \approx -0.63778</m>.  Since <m>V</m> is measured in thousands of dollars and <m>t</m> in years, we know that the portfolio's value is decreasing at a rate of <m>637.78</m> dollars per year on January 1, 2012.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>V'(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(t)</m>, it follows that <m>V''(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot (\ln(1.07))^2 - 6 \sin(t)</m>, and thus <m>V''(2) = 24 \cdot 1.07^2 \cdot \ln(1.07)^2 - 6 \sin(2) \approx -5.33</m>, with units ``thousands of dollars per year per year.''  This means that at the moment <m>t = 2</m>, the portfolio's value is decreasing at a decreasing rate.  More specifically, we know that <m>V'</m> is decreasing at the moment <m>t = 2</m> and expect the derivative's value to decrease by about <m>5.33</m> thousand dollars per year over the course of the next year.  In other words, the portfolio's value is not only decreasing, but we expect it to decrease more rapidly as the year goes on.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the figure below, we see plots of both <m>V</m> and <m>A</m> along with their corresponding derivatives.  We see that the function <m>A</m> is a purely exponential function that always increases at an increasing rate.  By adding the term <m>6\sin(t)</m> to <m>A</m> to create the function <m>V</m>, we add volatility to the value of the portfolio:  the oscillating nature of the sine function not only creates variance in the stock's value, but also in its rate of change.  We also observe that as time progresses and the value of <m>24 \cdot (1.07)^t</m> increases, the effect of <m>6 \sin(t)</m> lessens.

              The slope of the line tangent to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>a = \frac{\pi}{4}</m> is given by <m>f'\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)</m>. To find <m>f'\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)</m> we first find <m>f'(x)</m>, which is <m>f'(x) = -3\sin(x) - 2\cos(x)</m>.  Thus,

            <p>
              The linearization <m>L(x)</m> to <m>f</m> at <m>a = \pi</m> is <m>(x) = f(\pi) + f'(\pi)(x-\pi)</m>L.
              We calculated <m>f'(x)</m> in part (a) and so <m>f'(\pi) = -3\sin(\pi) - 2\cos(\pi) = 2</m>.  We also have <m>f(\pi) = 3\cos(\pi) - 2\sin(\pi) + 6 = 3</m>.  Hence <m>L(x) = 3+2(x-\pi)</m>.

              A differentiable function <m>f</m> is increasing at <m>x=a</m> if and only if <m>f'(a) \gt 0</m> and decreasing if and only if <m>f'(a) \lt 0</m>. Now  <m>f'\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -3\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -3</m>, so <m>f</m> is decreasing at <m>a = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.

              If a curve defined by a function <m>f</m> is concave up at <m>x=a</m>, then the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>x=a</m> lies below the curve and if the graph of <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>x=a</m>, then the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>x=a</m> lies above the curve. The concavity of a curve is determined by the second derivative and <m>f''(x) = -3\cos(x)+2\sin(x)</m>.  Since

                f''\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -3\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) + 2\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -2,

              the graph of <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>a = \frac{3\pi}{2}</m> and the tangent line to <m>f</m> lies above the curve at this point.

    <statement>
      <p>
        In this exercise,
        we explore how the limit definition of the derivative more formally shows that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)</m>.
        Letting <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>,
        note that the limit definition of the derivative tells us that
        <me>
          f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}
        </me>.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Recall the trigonometric identity for the sine of a sum of angles <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>:
              <m>\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</m>.
              Use this identity and some algebra to show that
              <me>
                f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)(\cos(h)-1) + \cos(x)\sin(h)}{h}

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Next, note that as <m>h</m> changes,
              <m>x</m> remains constant.
              Explain why it therefore makes sense to say that
              <me>
                f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) -1 }{h} + \cos(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}

          <li>
            <p>
              Finally,
              use small values of <m>h</m> to estimate the values of the two limits in (c):
              <me>
                \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) - 1}{h} \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}
              </me>.

          <li>
            <p>
              What do your results in (b) and (c) thus tell you about <m>f'(x)</m>?

            <p>
              By emulating the steps taken above,

        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              By definition, we know that 
              <me>
                f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}.

              By the sum of two angles identity for the sine function, <m>\sin(x+h) = \sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h)</m>, and thus
              <me>
                f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h) - \sin(x)}{h}.
              </me>.
              Combining the first and last terms and removing a factor of <m>\sin(x)</m>,
              <me>
                f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ \sin(x)(\cos(h)-1) + \cos(x)\sin(h) - \sin(x) }{h}.

            <p>
              Continuing our work in (a), we divide each part of the numerator by <m>h</m> and see it follows

                f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\sin(x) (\cos(h)-1) }{h}  + \frac{\cos(x)\sin(h)}{h} \right).
              </me>
              Next, we note that <m>\sin(x)</m> does not depend on <m>h</m>, and likewise <m>\cos(x)</m> is independent of <m>h</m>.  It thus makes sense to view those constants as being outside the limit being taken, and also that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.  Hence we write
              <me>
                f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\cos(h)-1}{h} \right)  + \cos(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\sin(h)}{h} \right).
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Using small positive and negative values of <m>h</m> to estimate the desired limits, we find that it appears 
              <me>
                \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\cos(h)-1}{h} \right) = 0
              </me>
              and
              <me>
                \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\sin(h)}{h} \right) = 1
              </me>
              It suffices in each case to consider <m>h</m>-values of <m>h = \pm 0.01, \pm 0.001, \pm 0.0001</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Combining our results in (b) and (c), we have found that 
              <me>
                f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\cos(h)-1}{h} \right)  + \cos(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\sin(h)}{h} \right) = \sin(x) \cdot 0 + \cos(x) \cdot 1 = \cos(x).
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The argument for showing <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)</m> is almost identical.  Do note that the sum of two angles identity for <m>\cos(\alpha + \beta)</m> is <m>\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta).</m>
