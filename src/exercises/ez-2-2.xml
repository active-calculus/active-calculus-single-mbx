<statement>
<p>
Suppose that <m>V(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t + 6 \sin(t)</m> represents the value of a person's investment portfolio in thousands of dollars in year <m>t</m>, where <m>t = 0</m> corresponds to January 1, 2010.
  <ol label="a.">
    <li><p>At what instantaneous rate is the portfolio's value changing on January 1, 2012?  Include units on your answer.</p></li>
    <li><p>Determine the value of <m>V''(2)</m>.  What are the units on this quantity and what does it tell you about how the portfolio's value is changing?</p></li>
    <li><p>On the interval <m>0 \le t \le 20</m>, graph the function <m>V(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t + 6 \sin(t)</m> and describe its behavior in the context of the problem.  Then, compare the graphs of the functions <m>A(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t</m> and <m>V(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t + 6 \sin(t)</m>, as well as the graphs of their derivatives <m>A'(t)</m> and <m>V'(t)</m>.  What is the impact of the term <m>6 \sin(t)</m> on the behavior of the function <m>V(t)</m>?</p></li>

Let <m>f(x) = 3\cos(x) - 2\sin(x) + 6</m>.
  <ol label="a.">
    <li><p>Determine the exact slope of the tangent line to <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point where <m>a = \frac{\pi}{4}</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Determine the tangent line approximation to <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point where <m>a = \pi</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>At the point where <m>a = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>, is <m>f</m> increasing, decreasing, or neither?</p></li>
    <li><p>At the point where <m>a = \frac{3\pi}{2}</m>, does the tangent line to <m>y = f(x)</m> lie above the curve, below the curve, or neither?  How can  you answer this question without even graphing the function or the tangent line?</p></li>

In this exercise, we explore how the limit definition of the derivative more formally shows that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)</m>. Letting <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>, note that the limit definition of the derivative tells us that
<me>
  f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}.
</me>
  <ol label="a.">
    <li><p>Recall the trigonometric identity for the sine of a sum of angles <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>:
     <m>\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</m>.  Use this identity and some algebra to show that
    <me>
      f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)(\cos(h)-1) + \cos(x)\sin(h)}{h}.
    </me></p></li>
    <li><p>Next, note that as <m>h</m> changes, <m>x</m> remains constant. Explain why it therefore makes sense to say that
    <me>
      f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) -1 }{h} + \cos(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}.
    </me></p></li>
    <li><p>Finally, use small values of <m>h</m> to estimate the values of the two limits in (c):
    <me>
      \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) - 1}{h} \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}.
    </me></p></li>
    <li><p>What do your results in (c) thus tell you about <m>f'(x)</m>?</p></li>
    <li><p>By emulating the steps taken above, use the limit definition of the derivative to argue convincingly that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x).</m></p></li>
