        The population of a species of fish in a lake is <m>P(t)</m> where
        <m>P</m> is measured in thousands of fish and <m>t</m> is measured in
        months.
        The growth of the population is described by the
        differential equation
        <me>
          \frac{dP}{dt} = f(P) = P(6-P)

              Sketch a graph of <m>f(P) = P(6-P)</m> and use it to determine the equilibrium solutions and whether they are stable or unstable.

              Suppose now that the owners of the lake allow fishers to remove 1000 fish from the lake every month (remember that <m>P(t)</m> is measured in
              <em>thousands</em> of fish).
              Modify the differential equation to take this into account.
              Sketch the new graph of <m>dP/dt</m> versus <m>P</m>.
              Determine the new equilibrium solutions and decide whether they are stable or unstable.
