        The examples we have considered in this section have all been for Taylor polynomials and series centered at 0, but Taylor polynomials and series can be centered at any value of <m>a</m>.
        We look at examples of such Taylor polynomials in this exercise.

              Then find the Taylor series for <m>f(x)</m> centered at <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.

        We can use known Taylor series to obtain other Taylor series,
        and we explore that idea in this exercise,
        as a preview of work in the following section.

            Calculate the first four derivatives of

            Part (a) demonstrates the brute force approach to computing Taylor polynomials and series.
            Now we find an easier method that utilizes a known Taylor series.
            Recall that the Taylor series centered at 0 for <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> is
            <men xml:id="eq-8-5-Exercise3">

                  Write out the first several terms and compare to your work in part (a).
                  Explain why the substitution in this problem should give the Taylor series for <m>\sin(x^2)</m> centered at 0.

        Based on the examples we have seen,
        we might expect that the Taylor series for a function <m>f</m> always converges to the values <m>f(x)</m> on its interval of convergence.
        We explore that idea in more detail in this exercise.
        Let <m>f(x) = \begin{cases}e^{-1/x^2} \amp \text{ if } x \neq 0, \\ 0 \amp \text{ if } x = 0. \end{cases}</m>

              It can be shown that
        <m>f^{(n)}(0) = 0</m> for all <m>n \geq 2</m>.
              Assuming that this is true,
        find the Taylor series for <m>f</m> centered at 0.

              What is the interval of convergence of the Taylor series centered at 0 for <m>f</m>?
              Explain.
              For which values of <m>x</m> the interval of convergence of the Taylor series does the Taylor series converge to <m>f(x)</m>?
