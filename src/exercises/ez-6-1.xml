    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) = 2-x^2</m>.
        Recall that the average value of any continuous function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> is given by <m>\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m>.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Find the average value of
              <m>f(x) = 2-x^2</m> on the interval <m>[0,\sqrt{2}]</m>.
              Call this value <m>r</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Sketch a graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> and <m>y = r</m>.
              Find their intersection point(s).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Show that on the interval <m>[0,\sqrt{2}]</m>,
              the amount of area that lies below
              <m>y = f(x)</m> and above <m>y = r</m> is equal to the amount of area that lies below <m>y = r</m> and above <m>y = f(x)</m>.
