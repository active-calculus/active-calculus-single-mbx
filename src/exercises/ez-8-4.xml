        Conditionally convergent series converge very slowly.
        As an example,
        consider the famous formula<fn>We will derive this formula in upcoming work.</fn><men xml:id="Ex-8-4-pi">
          \frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{k} \frac{1}{2k+1}

      <p>
        In theory, the partial sums of this series could be used to approximate <m>\pi</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        In this exercise,
        we examine one of the conditions of the Alternating Series Test.
        Consider the alternating series
        <me>
          1 - 1 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} + \cdots
        </me>,
        where the terms are selected alternately from the sequences
        <m>\left\{\frac{1}{n}\right\}</m> and <m>\left\{-\frac{1}{n^2}\right\}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why the <m>n</m>th term of the given series converges to 0 as <m>n</m> goes to infinity.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Rewrite the given series by grouping terms in the following manner:
              <me>
                (1 - 1) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{9}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16}\right) + \cdots
              </me>.
              Use this regrouping to determine if the series converges or diverges.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why the condition that the sequence <m>\{a_n\}</m> <em>decreases</em>
              to a limit of 0 is included in the Alternating Series Test.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Since both sequences <m>\left\{\frac{1}{n}\right\}</m> and
              <m>\left\{-\frac{1}{n^2}\right\}</m> converge to 0 as <m>n</m> goes to infinity,
              we see that the sequence of <m>n</m>th terms of our series converge to 0 as <m>n</m> goes to infinity.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Notice that <m>\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{k-1}{k^2}</m>.
              So our series can be rewritten as
              <me>
                \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k-1}{k^2}
              </me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since
              <me>
                \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{k-1}{k^2} }{ \frac{1}{k} } = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k^2-k}{k^2} = 1
              </me>,
              the Limit Comparison Test shows that the series
              <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k-1}{k^2}</m> behaves like the harmonic series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}</m>.
              Since the harmonic series diverges,
              it follows that the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k-1}{k^2}</m> diverges as well.

        Conditionally convergent series exhibit interesting and unexpected behavior.
        In this exercise we examine the conditionally convergent alternating harmonic series
        <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}</m> and discover that addition is not commutative for conditionally convergent series.
        We will also encounter Riemann's Theorem concerning rearrangements of conditionally convergent series.
        Before we begin, we remind ourselves that
        <me>
          \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} = \ln(2)
        </me>,
        a fact which will be verified in a later section.

            </me>
            for any real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
            This property is valid for any sum of finitely many terms,
            but does this property extend when we add infinitely many terms together?
          </p>

          <p>
            The answer is no, and something even more odd happens.
            Riemann's Theorem
            (after the nineteenth-century mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann)
            states that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to
            <em>any</em> prescribed sum.
            More specifically,
            this means that if we choose any real number <m>S</m>,
            we can rearrange the terms of the alternating harmonic series
            <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}</m> so that the sum is <m>S</m>.
            To understand how Riemann's Theorem works,
            let's assume for the moment that the number <m>S</m> we want our rearrangement to converge to is positive.
            Our job is to find a way to order the sum of terms of the alternating harmonic series to converge to <m>S</m>.
