              Using the central difference formula, we find that
              <me>
                F'(10) \approx \frac{F(10.01) - F(9.99)}{0.02} = \frac{(75 + 110 e^{-0.05\cdot 10.01}) - (75 + 110 e^{-0.05\cdot 9.99})}{0.02} \approx -3.33592.

          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>F</m> is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and <m>t</m> in minutes, we have <m>F'(10) \approx -3.33592</m> degrees F per minute.  This means that at the instant <m>t=10</m>, the temperature of the coffee is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of about <m>3.33592</m> degrees per minute.  Said differently, in the next minute, we'd expect the temperature of the coffee to drop about <m>3.33592</m> degrees.

            <p>
              We expect the coffee's temperature to decrease quickly early on when the difference between its temperature and the surroundings is greatest, and as time goes on for the coffee's temperature to approach that of the surrounding room.  Keeping in mind that <m>F</m> is an always decreasing function so that <m>F'</m> is always negative, we observe that <m>F'(10)</m> should be less (more negative) than <m>F'(20)</m>.  These observations can also be confirmed by plotting a graph of <m>F</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              We have noted that <m>F'</m> is always negative, and that we expect <m>F'</m> to get closer and closer to <m>0</m> as time goes on (that is, <m>F'</m> is increasing).  As such, we expect <m>F'</m> to look something like the graph of <m>y = -e^{-x}</m>.  This is reasonable since <m>-e^{-x}</m> is also an exponential function, is always negative, is always increasing, and approaches <m>0</m> as <m>x</m> increases.

              To say that <m>f(50) = 0.75</m> means that if a patient takes a dose of <m>50</m> ml of a drug, the patient will experience a body temperature change of <m>0.75</m> degrees F.

              Since the units of <m>f</m> are degrees F and the units of <m>q</m> are ml, it follows that the units of <m>s(q) = f'(q)</m> are ``degrees Fahrenheit per milliliter.''

This means that for a patient taking a <m>50</m> ml dose, adding one more ml to the dose leads us to expect a temperature change that is about <m>0.02</m> degrees less than the temperature change induced by a <m>50</m> ml dose.

          <li>
            <p>
              Observe that <m>v(t) = 16-32t</m> is a linear function with negative slope <m>-32</m>, and thus decreasing.  Since the function is of interest from <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t=2</m>, the velocity is greatest at the left endpoint, when <m>t=0</m>.  This greatest velocity is <m>v(0) = 16</m> feet per second.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>v</m> is a linear function, its slope is constant, and hence the slope of every tangent line to the function is the same as the slope of the line the function generates.  Thus, <m>v'(1) = -32</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Because <m>v</m> is measured in feet per second and <m>t</m> in seconds, the units on <m>v'(1)</m> are ``feet per second per second.'' Knowing that <m>v'(1) = -32</m>, this tells us that the ball's velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second; that is, for whatever the ball's velocity is at <m>t = 1</m>, we would expect the velocity to decrease by (exactly) <m>32</m> feet per second over the next one second.  (Normally this total decrease would be approximate, not exact, but since the velocity function is linear, we can compute the exact total change.)

          <li>
            <p>
              The instantaneous rate of change of velocity is precisely the acceleration of the ball.  Indeed, <m>v'(t)</m> tells us how the ball's velocity changes, and that it does so at a constant rate of <m>-32</m> feet per second per second.  This is also consistent with the fact that acceleration due to gravity is constant.

              To find the average rate of change of <m>h</m> on the interval <m>[40000,55000]</m>, we divide the change in <m>h</m> values (in dollars) on this interval by the change in <m>m</m> values (in miles) to obtain
              <me>
                AV_{[40000,55000]} = \frac{h(55000)- h(40000)}{55000-40000} = \frac{13200-15500}{15000} = -\frac{2300}{15000} \approx -0.153

              dollars per mile.  This tells us that from the mileage of <m>40 000</m> to <m>50 000</m> miles, on average the car's value decreases by <m>0.153</m> dollars per mile driven.

              Since <m>40 000</m> and <m>70 0000</m> are equidistant from <m>55 000</m>, we use the central difference quotient to approximate the derivative of <m>h</m> at <m>55 0000</m> to obtain
              <me>
                h'(55000) \approx \frac{h(70000) - h(40000)}{70000-40000} = \frac{11100-15500}{30000} = - \frac{4400}{30000} \approx -0.147
              </me>
              dollars per mile.  This approximation tells us that at the instant the car has been driven <m>55 000</m> miles, the car's value is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of <m>0.147</m> dollars per mile.  That is, during <m>55 0001</m>st mile, we'd expect the car's value to drop by <m>0.147</m> dollars.

              As we pile up miles on our car, we expect the value to go down. However, we should expect the depreciation to be more extreme at first, but less in magnitude as we drive more miles and our car gets older. Note, though, the the value of the car is always decreasing and <m>h'(m)</m> is always negative. Thus, we should expect that the rate of change of <m>h</m> is increasing (becoming less negative) as <m>m</m> increases and that <m>h'(30000) \lt h'(80000)</m>.

              The value of a car is never negative. So we know that <m>h(m) \geq 0</m> for all <m>m</m>. A new car decreases in value very quickly at first, and as the car gets older with more mileage, its value will depreciate to near zero. So <m>h</m> is a decreasing function. Since the value of our car always decreases, it follows that <m>h'(m) \lt 0</m> for all <m>m \gt 0</m>. The fact that the depreciation slows as <m>m</m> increases implies that <m>h'</m> is an increasing (getting less negative) function. Since <m>h'</m> is increasing, it follows that <m>h</m> is bends upward; we will study this issue more in Section 1.6. So the graph of <m>h</m> might have the general shape of the graph of <m>y = e^{-x}</m> for positive values of <m>x</m>.
