        A sailboat is sitting at rest near its dock.
        A rope attached to the bow of the boat is drawn in over a pulley that stands on a post on the end of the dock that is 5 feet higher than the bow.
        If the rope is being pulled in at a rate of 2 feet per second,

        Using the given information, we construct the figure shown below.

      <p permid="Wuc">
        As pictured,
        we know that <m>5</m> is the vertical height from the pulley to the level of the bow of the boat,
        and we let <m>z</m> be the length of the rope from the pulley to the bow of the boat,
        and <m>x</m> the horizontal distance from the dock to the bow of the boat.
      </p>

      <p permid="CBl">
        We are given that the rope is being pulled in at <m>2</m> feet per second,
        and thus <m>\frac{dz}{dt} = -2</m> feet per second.
        Because we want to know how fast the boat is approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet,
        we want to know <m>\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z=13}</m>.
        Thus, we need to relate the changing quantities <m>z</m> and <m>x</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="iIu">
        Because the rope, the post
        (vertically extended),
        and the horizontal distance from the bow of the boat to the post on the dock form a right triangle at all times,
        it follows that
        <me permid="phA">
          x^2 + 5^2 = z^2
        </me>.
        Having now related <m>z</m> and <m>x</m>,
        we differentiate this equation with respect to <m>t</m>.
        By the chain rule, we now see that
        <me permid="VoJ">
          2x \frac{dx}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}
        </me>.
        At the instant <m>z = 13</m>,
        <m>x^2 + 5^2 = 13^2</m>, and thus <m>x = 12</m>.
        Using all of the given information at the instant <m>z = 13</m> (including that <m>\frac{dz}{dt} = -2</m>),
        <me permid="BvS">
          2(12) \left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13} = 2(13)(-2)
        </me>.
        Solving for <m>\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13}</m>,
        <me permid="hDb">
          \left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13} = -\frac{13}{6}

        feet per second.
        Thus the boat is approaching the dock at a rate of <m>\frac{13}{6} \approx 2.167</m> feet per second.

        The depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution permid="FvR">
      <p permid="OPD">
        The variables in this problem are the volume <m>V</m> of water in the pool and the depth <m>y</m> of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool);
        each is implicitly a function of time, <m>t</m>.
        We are given that <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> is a constant <m>800</m> cubic feet per minute and want to find <m>\frac{dh}{dt}\bigm|_{h=5}</m>.
        To do this, we first need to relate <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.
        The volume of the water in the pool at height
        <m>h \lt 12</m> is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height <m>h</m>
        (as shown in the figure below)
        times the width (25 feet) of the pool.
        The height of the triangular cross section is <m>h</m> and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.
      </p>

      <sidebyside width="65%" permid="PUW">
        <image source="images/3_5_Ez2Soln" />
      </sidebyside>

      <p permid="uWM">
        Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure,
        the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line connecting the points <m>(0,-15)</m> and <m>(60, -3)</m>.
        This line has slope <m>\frac{12}{60} = 0.2</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,-15)</m>.
        So the equation of this line is <m>y = 0.2x-15</m>.
        It is the <m>x</m> coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>h-15</m> that is the length of the triangle whose height is <m>h</m>.
        So the length <m>l</m> is <m>l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h</m>.
        Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height <m>h</m> is
        <me permid="tRt">
          V = \left(\frac{1}{2}(h)(5h)\right)(25) = 62.5h^2
        </me>.
        Both <m>V</m> and <m>h</m> are functions of time.
        Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to  <m>t</m> gives
        <me permid="ZYC">
          \frac{dV}{dt} = 62.5(2h) \frac{dh}{dt}
        </me>,
        so
        <me permid="GfL">
          \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{125h} \frac{dV}{dt}
        </me>.
        When the depth of water in the pool is <m>5</m> feet,
        then the depth is increasing at the rate
        <me permid="mmU">
          \left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{h = 5} = \frac{1}{125(5)} (800) = 1.28
        </me>
        feet per minute.
        Since <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> is inversely proportional to <m>h</m>,
        the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as <m>h</m> increases,
        so the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.
