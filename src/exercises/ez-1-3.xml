    <title>Using the limit definition of the derivative</title>
    -->
    <statement>
      <p>
        The goal of this problem is to compute the value of the derivative at a point for several different functions,
        where for each one we do so in three different ways,
        and then to compare the results to see that each produces the same value.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each of the following functions,
        use the limit definition of the derivative to compute the value of <m>f'(a)</m> using three different approaches:
        strive to use the algebraic approach first
        (to compute the limit exactly),
        then test your result using numerical evidence
        (with small values of <m>h</m>),
        and finally plot the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> near
        <m>(a,f(a))</m> along with the appropriate tangent line to estimate the value of <m>f'(a)</m> visually.
        Compare your findings among all three approaches;
        if you are unable to complete the algebraic approach,
        still work numerically and graphically.

              Hence,
              <md>
                <mrow>f'(\frac{\pi}{2}) &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(\frac{\pi}{2}+h)-f(\frac{\pi}{2})}{h} </mrow>
                <mrow>                      &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) - 1}{h} </mrow>
              </md>               
              At this point, we encounter a limit that we are unable to evaluate further using algebraic means.  Like the earlier limit above, we can estimate the limit using small values of <m>h</m>.  Doing so confirms that this limit also approaches <m>0</m>, and we hence conclude that <m>f'(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0</m>.
