<statement>

Consider the functions <m>r(t) = t^t</m> and <m>s(t) = \arccos(t)</m>, for which you are given the facts that <m>r'(t) = t^t(\ln(t) + 1)</m> and <m>s'(t) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}</m>. Do not be concerned with where these derivative formulas come from. We restrict our interest in both functions to the domain <m>0 \lt  t \lt  1</m>.

    <li><p>Let <m>w(t) = 3t^t - 2\arccos(t)</m>.  Determine <m>w'(t)</m>.</p></li>

<statement>

Let <m>f(x) = a^x</m>. The goal of this problem is to explore how the value of <m>a</m> affects the derivative of <m>f(x)</m>, without assuming we know the rule for <m>\frac{d}{dx}[a^x]</m> that we have stated and used in earlier work in this section.
  <ol label="a.">
    <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that
    <me>
      f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^x \cdot a^h - a^x}{h}.
    </me></p></li>
    <li><p>Explain why it is also true that
    <me>
      f'(x) = a^x \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^h - 1}{h}.
    </me></p></li>
    <li><p>Use computing technology and small values of <m>h</m> to estimate the value of
    <me>
      L = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^h - 1}{h}
    </me>
    when <m>a = 2</m>.  Do likewise when <m>a = 3</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Note that it would be ideal if the value of the limit <m>L</m> was <m>1</m>, for then <m>f</m> would be a particularly special function:  its derivative would be simply <m>a^x</m>, which would mean that its derivative is itself.  By experimenting with different values of <m>a</m> between <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>, try to find a value for <m>a</m> for which
    <me>
      L = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^h - 1}{h} = 1.
    </me></p></li>
    <li><p>Compute <m>\ln(2)</m> and <m>\ln(3)</m>.  What does your work in (b) and (c) suggest is true about <m>\frac{d}{dx}[2^x]</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}[3^x]</m>?</p></li>
    <li><p>How do your investigations in (d) lead to a particularly important fact about the function
    <m>f(x) = e^x</m>?</p></li>
