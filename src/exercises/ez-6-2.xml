        <statement>
          <p>Consider the curve <m>f(x) = 3 \cos(\frac{x^3}{4})</m> and the portion of its graph that lies in the first quadrant between the <m>y</m>-axis and the first positive value of <m>x</m> for which <m>f(x) = 0</m>. Let <m>R</m> denote the region bounded by this portion of <m>f</m>, the <m>x</m>-axis, and the <m>y</m>-axis.

          <ol label="a.">
            <li><p>Set up a definite integral whose value is the exact arc length of <m>f</m> that lies along the upper boundary of <m>R</m>.  Use technology appropriately to evaluate the integral you find.</p></li>

            <li><p>Set up a definite integral whose value is the exact area of <m>R</m>.  Use technology appropriately to evaluate the integral you find.</p></li>

            <li><p>Suppose that the region <m>R</m> is revolved around the <m>x</m>-axis.  Set up a definite integral whose value is the exact volume of the solid of revolution that is generated.   Use technology appropriately to evaluate the integral you find.</p></li>

            <li><p>Suppose instead that <m>R</m> is revolved around the <m>y</m>-axis.  If possible, set up an integral expression whose value is the exact volume of the solid of revolution and evaluate the integral using appropriate technology.  If not possible, explain why.</p></li>
