        there is a bike bath that runs almost directly north-south.

              The velocity function of the biker tells us that for the first hour,
              the biker pedals north at a velocity of <m>11</m> miles per hour.
              At the <m>1</m>-hour mark,
              the biker abruptly changes direction and then pedals south at <m>10</m> miles per hour for the next two hours;
              finally, at the <m>3</m>-hour mark,
              the biker again changes direction and then pedals north at <m>9</m> mph for the last hour of their trip.
            </p>

            <p permid="cck">
              Thus, the biker traveled <m>11</m> miles north from their starting point
              (mile <m>1</m>)
              and thus made the turn at <m>t = 1</m> at mile <m>12</m>.
              Two hours later, having pedaled south at <m>10</m> mph,
              they'd traveled <m>20</m> miles south,
              and thus were at mile <m>12 - 20 = -8</m> relative to Pigeon Lake.
              Finally, after biking at <m>9</m> mph north for the lat hour,
              they were back at mile <m>-8 + 9 = 1</m>.
            </p>

            <p permid="Ijt">
              The furthest north the biker was occurred at time <m>t = 1</m>.
              This occurs because it is the only time when the derivative of the biker's position function changes from positive to negative,
              and thus <m>s</m> has a local maximum.
              In addition,
              we can see this based on our discussion above of how far the biker traveled in each direction on the various time intervals,
              and that the biker was <m>12</m> miles north of the lake at <m>t = 1</m>.

              The cyclist's total change in position is <m>s(4) - s(0) = 0</m>.
              In part (a), we established that <m>s(1) = 12</m>,
              <m>s(3) = -8</m>, and <m>s(4) = 1</m>.
              We were given that <m>s(0) = 1</m>.
              Thus, <m>s(4) - s(0) = 0</m>,
              and the biker ended up back where they started the trip.

              then <m>20</m> miles south, and finally <m>9</m> miles north.
              Since <m>11 + 20 + 9 = 40</m>,
              their total distance traveled is <m>40</m> miles,

              In the following figure,
              we see an approximate plot of the biker's position function.
              Since their velocity is constant on the various intervals,
              their position function is linear on those intervals with slope that matches the velocity.
              In addition, as pictured,
              the position function passes through the points we've established above like <m>(3,-8)</m>.

              To find the exact total distance traveled,
              we need to calculate the area under the velocity function on the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.

              Note that <m>s(2)</m> was found to be <m>\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \pi</m> in part (a) and

              Since <m>v(t)</m> is positive to the left of <m>t=2</m> and then negative to the right of <m>t=2</m>,
              the position function <m>s</m> is increasing to the left of <m>t=2</m> then decreasing to the right of <m>t=2</m>.

              If we think about an interval on which the rate of pollution is relatively constant and suppose the interval is <m>\triangle t</m> wide,

              the polution rate on that interval.
              When we compute the product <m>p(t) \cdot \triangle t</m> to find the area,
              the units involved are ``units of pollution per day'' times ``days'', which results in an overall unit of ``units of pollution''. Thus,

              One way to estimate the total amount of pollution is to suppose the rate of pollution is constant on each of the intervals <m>[0,6]</m>,
              <m>[6,12]</m>, <m>..</m>..  For instance,
              we could assume the rate on <m>[0,6]</m> is always <m>7</m> units per day,
              and then the rate jumps to <m>8</m> units per day on <m>[6,12]</m>,
              and so on.
              Doing so, and using the ideas we discussed in (b),
              one estimate for the total pollution, <m>P</m>, is
              <me permid="sEW">
                P = 7 \cdot 6 + 8 \cdot 6 + 10 \cdot 6 + 13 \cdot 6 + 18 \cdot 6 + 35 \cdot 6 = 546
              </me>
              total units of pollution.
              Note, for example, that when we compute
              <m>13 \cdot 6</m> this represents an estimate of the total amount of pollution emitted on the interval <m>[18,24]</m> since we are assuming the plant emits <m>13</m> units of pollution per day for 6 days.
              It is apparent that this particular estimate is an underestimate of the total amount of pollution since the rate is always increasing but we are choosing the lowest value of that rate on a given interval.
