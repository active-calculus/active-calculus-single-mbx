Suppose that <m>T(t)</m> represents the temperature of a cup of
coffee set out in a room, where <m>T</m> is expressed in degrees
Fahrenheit and <m>t</m> in minutes. A physical principle known as Newton's Law of Cooling<idx><h>Newton's Law of Cooling</h></idx> tells us that
<me>
  \frac{dT}{dt}= -\frac1{15}T+5.
</me>
<ol label="a.">
<li><p>Supposes that <m>T(0)=105</m>.  What does the differential
    equation give us for the value of <m>\frac{dT}{dt}\vert_{T=105}</m>?  Explain in a
    complete sentence the meaning of these two facts.</p></li>

<statement>

Suppose that the population of a particular species is
described by the function <m>P(t)</m>, where <m>P</m> is expressed in
millions. Suppose further that the population's rate of change is
governed by the differential equation
<me>
  \frac{dP}{dt} = f(P)

where <m>f(P)</m> is the function graphed below.

<statement>
<p>
In this problem, we test further what it means for a function to be a solution to a given differential equation.
<ol label="a.">
<li><p>Consider the differential equation
<me>
  \frac{dy}{dt} = y - t.
</me>
Determine whether the following functions are solutions to the given differential equation.
<ul>
<li>
<title>(i)</title>
<p>
<m>y(t) = t + 1 + 2e^t</m></p></li>
<li>
<title>(ii)</title>
<p>
<m>y(t) = t + 1</m></p></li>
<li>
<title>(iii)</title>
<p>
<m>y(t) = t + 2</m></p></li>

<li><p>When you weigh bananas in a scale at the grocery store, the
      height <m>h</m> of the bananas is described by the differential
      equation
<me>
  \frac{d^2h}{dt^2} = -kh
</me>
where <m>k</m> is the <em>spring constant</em>, a constant that depends
      on the properties of the spring in the scale.  After you put the
      bananas in the scale, you (cleverly) observe that the height of the bananas
      is given by <m>h(t) = 4\sin(3t)</m>.  What is the value of the spring
      constant?</p></li>
