            When you weigh bananas in a scale at the grocery store, the
            height <m>h</m> of the bananas is described by the differential
            equation
            <me>
              \frac{d^2h}{dt^2} = -kh
            </me>
            where <m>k</m> is the <em>spring constant</em>,
            a constant that depends
            on the properties of the spring in the scale.
            After you put the
            bananas in the scale,
            you (cleverly) observe that the height of the bananas
            is given by <m>h(t) = 4\sin(3t)</m>.
            What is the value of the spring
            constant?
