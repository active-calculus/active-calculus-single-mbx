			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					On the time interval <m>[0,4]</m> the jumper has the greatest change in position over that period of time, so it is on that interval that her average velocity is greatest in magnitude (but negative in sign).

					We can approximate the jumper's average velocity on the intervals <m>[4.9,5]</m> and <m>[5,5.1]</m> and find the average of these average velocities. This will give us the slope of the secant line connecting the points <m>(4.9, s(4.9))</m> and <m>(5.1, s(5.1))</m> and be a reasonably good approximation to the instantaneous velocity at <m>t = 5</m>.  Now
					<md>
						<mrow>AV_{[4.9,5]} &amp;= \frac{s(5)-s(4.9)}{5-4.9} \approx  21.31</mrow>
						<mrow>AV_{[5,5.1]} &amp;= \frac{s(5.1)-s(5)}{5.1-5} \approx  22.25</mrow>

					feet per second.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The average velocities we calculated were all negative, while the instantaneous velocity was positive. When the jumper is moving in the downward direction, the average velocity will be negative (indicating a decrease in position), while a positive average velocity indicates an increase in position (moving upwards).

    <statement>
      <p>
        According to the U.S. census,
        the population of the city of Grand Rapids, MI, was 181,843 in 1980; 189,126 in 1990; and 197,800 in 2000.

          <li>Between 1980 and 2000,

          <li>In an average year between 1980 and 2000,
            by how many people did the population of Grand Rapids grow?</li>

          <li>Just like we can find the average velocity of a moving body by computing change in position over change in time,
            we can compute the average rate of change of any function <m>f</m>.
            In particular, the <em>average rate of change</em>

            What does the quantity
            <m>\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</m> measure on the graph of
            <m>y = f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[a,b]</m>?</li>

          <li>Let <m>P(t)</m> represent the population of Grand Rapids at time <m>t</m>,
            where <m>t</m> is measured in years from January 1, 1980.
            What is the average rate of change of <m>P</m> on the interval <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t = 20</m>?
            What are the units on this quantity?</li>

          <li>If we assume the population of Grand Rapids is growing at a rate of approximately 4<percent /> per decade,
            we can model the population function with the formula
            <me>
              P(t) = 181843 (1.04)^{t/10}

        <m>[5,7]</m>, and <m>[5,6]</m>.</li>

          <li>How fast do you think the population of Grand Rapids was changing on January 1, 1985?
            Said differently,
            at what rate do you think people were being added to the population of Grand Rapids as of January 1, 1985?
