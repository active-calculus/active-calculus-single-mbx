        The mass of a radioactive sample decays at a rate that is
        proportional to its mass.

            <p>
              Express this fact as a differential equation for the mass <m>M(t)</m> using <m>k</m> for the constant of proportionality.

              The <em>half-life</em>
              of the sample is the amount of time required for half of the mass to decay.
              Knowing that the half-life of Carbon-14 is 5730 years,
              find the value of <m>k</m> for a sample of Carbon-14.

              How long does it take for a sample of Carbon-14 to be reduced to one-quarter its original mass?

            <p>
              Carbon-14 naturally occurs in our environment; any
              living organism takes in Carbon-14 when it eats and breathes.
              Upon
              dying,
              however, the organism no longer takes in Carbon-14.

              Suppose that you find remnants of a pre-historic firepit.
              By
              analyzing the charred wood in the pit, you determine that the
              amount of Carbon-14 is only 30<percent /> of the amount in living trees.
              Estimate the age of the firepit.<fn>This approach is the basic idea behind radiocarbon dating.</fn></p>

              A differential equation that represents the given description is
              <me>
                \frac{dM}{dt} = kM
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Separating the variables to solve the differential equation yields
              <me>
                \frac{1}{M} \, dM = k \, dt
              </me>
              so 
              <me>
                \int \frac{1}{M} \, dM = \int k \, dt 
              </me>.
              Integrating and solving for <m>M</m>, we find <m>\ln|M| = kt + C</m> and thus <m>M = e^{kt+C} = e^{kt}e^C = Ke^{kt}</m> for some constant <m>K</m>.  Using the initial condition <m>M(0) = M_0</m>, it follows that <m>K = M_0</m>.  Therefore, the mass at time <m>t</m> is given by 
              <me>
                M(t) = M_0e^{kt}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If we let <m>5730</m> years pass from time <m>0</m>, the remaining mass of the radioactive sample will be <m>\frac{1}{2}M_0</m>. This allows us to find the value of <m>k</m> by setting <m>M(5730)</m> equal to <m>\frac{1}{2}M_0</m> and solving for <m>t</m>.  Doing so, we have <m>\frac{1}{2}M_0 = M_0e^{5730k}</m>, and thus <m>\frac{1}{2} = e^{5730k}</m>.  It follows that
              <me>
                \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 5730k
              </me>
              from which we find <m>k = \frac{1}{5730}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}</m>.
              Hence, 
              <me>
                M(t) = M_0e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}t} \approx M_0e^{-0.000121t}
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Now we want to find the time <m>t</m> so that <m>M(t) = \frac{1}{4}M_0</m>.  Similar work to our recent efforts in (c) shows that <m>t = \frac{5730\ln(4)}{\ln(2)} \approx 11460</m> years.  This number makes sense because it takes <m>5730</m> years for half of the sample to decay, then another <m>5730</m> years for half to decay again, for a total of <m>(2)(5730)</m> years for the substance to decay to one quarter of its original amount.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We want to find the time it takes for <m>M(t)</m> to be <m>30</m><percent /> of <m>M_0</m>, so we need to solve <m>0.3M_0 = M_0e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}t}</m>.  Doing so in the usual way, we find that <m>t = -\frac{5730\ln(0.3)}{\ln(2)} \approx 9952.8</m> years, so we estimate that the sample is about <m>9973</m> years old.

              Separating the variables, we find that

                y \frac{dy}{dt} = -t

              <me>
                \int y \, dy = -\int t \,dt
              </me>.
              Evaluating the integrals and solving for <m>y</m>, we see that

        Suppose that a cylindrical water tank with a hole in the

              If one tank has <m>k=-1</m> and the other has <m>k=-10</m>, the tank with <m>k = -10</m> will have water leaving the tank much more rapidly, which should correspond to that tank having a larger hole.

              Since height decreases at <m>20</m> inches per minute when the water is filled to a depth of <m>100</m> inches, this tells us that <m>\frac{dh}{dt}\vert_{h=100} = -20</m>.  Applying this information to the differential equation,
              <me>
                -20 = k \sqrt{100}
              </me>
              and thus <m>k = -5</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              To solve the differential equation <m>\frac{dh}{dt} = -5 \sqrt{h}</m> with initial condition <m>h(0) = 100</m>, we first separate the variables and write
              <me>
                \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \frac{dh}{dt} = -5
              </me>.
              Rewriting the first fraction and integrating with respect to <m>t</m>, we have
              <me>
                \int h^{-1/2} \, dh = \int -5 \, dt
              </me>
              and thus
              <me>
                2h^{1/2} = -5t + C
              </me>,
              or <m>h = \left( C - 2.5t \right)^2</m>.  Knowing that <m>h(0) = 100</m>, we see that
              <m>100 = C^2</m>, and thus <m>C = 5</m>.  This shows that the solution to the IVP is
              <me>
                h(t) = \left( 5 - 2.5t \right)^2
              </me>.
              A plot of this function shows it to be a concave up parabola with <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,25)</m> and a repeated zero at <m>(2.5,0)</m>.

              It takes <m>2.5</m> minutes for the tank to empty since <m>h(2.5) = 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              No, this solution is not valid for all time <m>t</m>.  The physical constraints of the problem tell us that the solution is only valid for <m>0 \lt t \lt 2.5</m> since at <m>t = 2.5</m> the tank is empty.

              The only equilibrium solution is <m>P = 3</m>, since <m>\ln(1) = 0</m> (note: <m>\ln(0)</m> is undefined, so the differential equation is not defined for <m>P = 0</m>).  From the slope field pictured in (a), the equilibrium solution <m>P = 3</m> is stable.

              To solve the IVP with <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = -P\ln\left(\frac P3\right)</m> and <m>P(0) = 1</m>, we use separation of variables.  Observe that
              <me>
                \frac{1}{P\ln\left(\frac P3\right)}\frac{dP}{dt} = -1
              </me>
              and thus
              <me>
                \int \frac{1}{P\ln\left(\frac P3\right)} \, dP = - \int 1 \, dt
              </me>
              On the left, using the substitution <m>u = \ln (P/3)</m>, it follows <m>du = \frac{3}{P} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \, dP</m>, we can rewrite the most recent equation as
              <me>
                \int \frac{du}{u} = - \int 1 \, dt
              </me>.
              Therefore,
              <me>
                \ln |u| = -t + C
              </me>,
              so
              <m>|u| = e^{C-t}</m>, or <m>u = Ke^{-t}</m>.  Next, we recall that <m>u = \ln \left(\frac P3\right)</m>, so 
              <me>
                \frac{P}{3} = e^{Ke^{-t}}
              </me>
              and
              <m>P = 3e^{Ke^{-t}}</m>.
              Applying the initial condition, <m>1 = 3e^K</m>, so <m>K = \ln \left(\frac{1}{3} \right)</m>, and thus
              <me>
                P(t) = 3e^{\ln \left(\frac{1}{3} \right) e^{-t}}
              </me>.
              This function's plot is shown in blue in the image above in (a) and we see (both graphically and algebraically) that <m>P(t) \to 3</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m> since <m>e^{-t} \to 0</m>.

              Changing the initial condition to <m>P(0) = 6</m>, we can use all of our preceding work in (c) up to where we established <m>P = 3e^{Ke^{-t}}</m>.
              Applying this initial condition, <m>6 = 3e^K</m>, so <m>K = \ln \left(2 \right)</m>, and thus
              <me>
                P(t) = 3e^{\ln \left( 2 \right) e^{-t}}
              </me>.
              This function's plot is shown in red in the image above in (a) and we see (both graphically and algebraically) that <m>P(t) \to 3</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m> since <m>e^{-t} \to 0</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Our work in (c) and (d) suggests that regardless of the initial condition with <m>P(0) \gt 0</m>, the long-term behavior of <m>P</m> will be for it to tend to <m>3</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound.  This matches our initial observations based on the slope field.
