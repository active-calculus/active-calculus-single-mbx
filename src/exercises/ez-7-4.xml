      <p>
        The mass of a radioactive sample decays at a rate that is
        proportional to its mass.
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Express this fact as a differential equation for the mass <m>M(t)</m> using <m>k</m> for the constant of proportionality.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the initial mass is <m>M_0</m>,
              find an expression for the mass <m>M(t)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The <em>half-life</em>
              of the sample is the amount of time required for half of the mass to decay.
              Knowing that the half-life of Carbon-14 is 5730 years,
              find the value of <m>k</m> for a sample of Carbon-14.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How long does it take for a sample of Carbon-14 to be reduced to one-quarter its original mass?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Carbon-14 naturally occurs in our environment; any
              living organism takes in Carbon-14 when it eats and breathes.
              Upon
              dying,
              however, the organism no longer takes in Carbon-14.

              Suppose that you find remnants of a pre-historic firepit.
              By
              analyzing the charred wood in the pit, you determine that the
              amount of Carbon-14 is only 30<percent /> of the amount in living trees.
              Estimate the age of the firepit.<fn>This approach is the basic idea behind radiocarbon dating.</fn></p>

        Suppose that a cylindrical water tank with a hole in the
        bottom is filled with water.
        The water, of course, will leak out
        and the height of the water will decrease.
        Let <m>h(t)</m> denote the
        height of the water.
        A physical principle called <em>Torricelli's
        Law</em> implies that the height decreases at a rate proportional to
        the square root of the height.

        The <em>Gompertz equation</em> is a model that is used to
