  <introduction>
    <p>
      In previous chapters,
      we have seen that a function's derivative tells us the rate at which the function is changing.
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus helped us determine the total change of a function over an interval from the function's rate of change.
      For instance,
      an object's velocity tells us the rate of change of that object's position.
      By integrating the velocity over a time interval,
      we can determine how much the position changes over that time interval.
      If we know where the object is at the beginning of that interval,
      we have enough information to predict where it will be at the end of the interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this chapter, we introduce the concept of
      <em>differential equations</em>.
      A differential equation is an equation that provides a description of a function's derivative,
      which means that it tells us the function's rate of change.
      Using this information,
      we would like to learn as much as possible about the function itself.
      Ideally we would like to have an algebraic description of the function.
      As we'll see, this may be too much to ask in some situations,
      but we will still be able to make accurate approximations.
    </p>

  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>What is a differential equation?</title>
          <idx><h>differential equation</h></idx>

    <p>
      A differential equation is an equation that describes the derivative,
      or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us.
      For instance, the equation
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = x\sin x
      </me>
      describes the derivative of a
      function <m>y(x)</m> that is unknown to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      As many important examples of differential equations involve quantities
      that change in time, the independent variable in our discussion will
      frequently be time
      <m>t</m>.
      In the preview activity, we considered the
      differential equation
      <me>
        \frac{ds}{dt} = 4t + 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing the velocity and the starting position of a moving object,
      we were able to find its position at any later time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because differential equations describe the derivative of a function,
      they give us information about how that function changes.
      Our goal will be to use this information to predict the value of the function in the future;
      in this way,
      differential equations provide us with something like a crystal ball.
    </p>

    <p>
      Differential equations arise frequently in our every day world.
      For instance, you may hear a bank advertising:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Your money will grow at a 3<percent /> annual interest rate with us.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This innocuous statement is really a differential equation.
      Let's
      translate: <m>A(t)</m> will be amount of money you have in your account at
      time <m>t</m>.
      The rate at which your money grows is the
      derivative <m>dA/dt</m>, and we are told that this rate is
      <m>0.03 A</m>.
      This leads to the differential equation
      <me>
        \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.03 A
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This differential equation has a slightly different feel than the previous equation <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1</m>.
      In the earlier example,
      the rate of change depends only on the independent variable <m>t</m>,
      and we may find <m>s(t)</m> by integrating the velocity <m>4t+1</m>.
      In the banking example, however,
      the rate of change depends on the dependent variable <m>A</m>,
      so we'll need some new techniques in order to find <m>A(t)</m>.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Differential equations in the world around us</title>
    <p>
      Differential equations give a natural way to describe phenomena we see in the real world.
      For instance, physical principles are frequently expressed as a description of how a quantity changes.
      A good example is Newton's Second Law,
      which says:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>The product of an object's mass and acceleration equals the force applied to it. </em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      For instance,
      when gravity acts on an object near the earth's surface,
      it exerts a force equal to <m>mg</m>,
      the mass of the object times the
      gravitational constant <m>g</m>.
      We therefore have
      <md>
        <mrow>ma =\mathstrut \amp  mg, \ \text{or}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  g</mrow>
      </md>,
      where <m>v</m> is the velocity of the object,
      and <m>g = 9.8</m> meters per
      second squared.
      Notice that this physical principle does not tell us
      what the object's
      velocity is, but rather how the object's velocity changes.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-7-1-2.xml" />

    <p>
      The point of this activity is to demonstrate how differential equations model processes in the real world.
      In this example, two factors influence the velocities:
      gravity and wind resistance.
      The differential equation describes how these factors influence the rate of change of the velocities.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Solving a differential equation</title>
          <idx><h>differential equation</h><h>solution</h></idx>

    <p>
      A differential equation describes the derivative,
      or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us.
      By a <em>solution</em> to a differential equation,
      we mean simply a function that satisies this description.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, the first differential equation we looked at is
      <me>
        \frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1
      </me>,
      which describes an unknown function <m>s(t)</m>.
      We may check that <m>s(t) =
      2t^2+t</m> is a solution because it satisfies this description.
      Notice
      that <m>s(t) = 2t^2+t+4</m> is also a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we have a candidate for a solution, it is straightforward to
      check whether it is a solution or not.
      Before we demonstrate,
      however, let's consider the same issue in a simpler context.
      Suppose we are given the equation
      <m>2x^2 - 2x = 2x+6</m> and asked whether <m>x=3</m> is a solution.
      To answer
      this question,
      we could rewrite the variable <m>x</m> in the equation with
      the symbol <m>\Box</m>:
      <me>
        2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\Box + 6
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To determine whether <m>x=3</m> is a solution,
      we can investigate the value of each side of the equation separately when the value <m>3</m> is placed in <m>\Box</m> and see if indeed the two resulting values are equal.
      Doing so, we observe that
      <me>
        2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\cdot3^2 - 2\cdot3 = 12
      </me>,
      and
      <me>
        2\Box + 6 = 2\cdot3 + 6 = 12
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, <m>x=3</m> is indeed a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will do the same thing with differential equations.
      Consider
      the differential equation
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5v, \ \text{or}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{d\Box}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5\Box</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's ask whether <m>v(t) = 3 - 2e^{-0.5t}</m> is a solution<fn>At this time,
      don't worry about why we chose this function;  we will learn
      techniques for finding solutions to differential equations soon enough.</fn>.
      Using this formula for <m>v</m>, observe first that
      <me>
        \frac{dv}{dt} =  \frac{d\Box}{dt}  = \frac{d}{dt}[3 - 2e^{-0.5t}] = -2e^{-0.5t} \cdot (-0.5) = e^{-0.5t}
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5\Box= 1.5 - 0.5(3 - 2e^{-0.5t}) = 1.5 - 1.5 + e^{-0.5t} = e^{-0.5t}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>\frac{dv}{dt}</m> and
      <m>1.5 - 0.5v</m> agree for all values of <m>t</m> when <m>v = 3-2e^{-0.5t}</m>,
      we have indeed found a solution to the differential equation.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-7-1-3.xml" />
      <p>
        This activity shows us something interesting.
        Notice that the differential equation has infinitely many solutions,
        which are parametrized by the constant <m>C</m> in <m>v(t) = 3+Ce^{-0.5t}</m>.
        In <xref ref="F-7-1-family">Figure</xref>,
        we see the graphs of these solutions for a few values of <m>C</m>,
        as labeled.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="F-7-1-family">
        <caption>The family of solutions to the differential equation <m>\frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5 - 0.5v</m>.</caption>
        <image width="47%" source="images/7_1_family" />
      </figure>
    
    <p>
      Notice that the value of <m>C</m> is connected to the initial value of the velocity <m>v(0)</m>,
      since <m>v(0) = 3+C</m>.
      In other words,
      while the differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself,
      this is not enough information to determine the velocity uniquely:
      we also need to know the initial velocity.
      For this reason,
      differential equations will typically have infinitely many solutions,
      one corresponding to each initial value.
      We have seen this phenomenon before:
      given the velocity of a moving object <m>v(t)</m>,
      we cannot uniquely determine the object's position function unless we also know its initial position.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we are given a differential equation and an initial value for the
      unknown function, we say that we have an
      <em>initial value problem.</em>
      For instance,
      <me>
        \frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v, \ v(0) = 0.5
      </me>
      is an initial value problem.
      In this problem, we know the value of
      <m>v</m> at one time and we know how <m>v</m> is changing.
      Consequently, there should
      be exactly one function <m>v</m> that satisfies the initial value problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      This demonstrates the following important general property of initial value problems.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <p>
        Initial value problems that are
        <q>well behaved</q> have exactly one solution,
        which exists in some interval around the initial point.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      We won't worry about what <q>well behaved</q>
      means<mdash />it is a technical
      condition that will be satisfied by all the differential equations we
      consider.
    </p>

    <p>
      To close this section,
      we note that differential equations may be classified based on certain characteristics they may possess.
      You may see many different types of differential equations in a later course in differential equations.
      For now, we would like to introduce a few terms that are used to describe differential equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <em>first-order</em> differential equation
          <idx><h>differential equation</h><h>first order</h></idx>
      is one in which only the
      first derivative of the function occurs.
      For this reason,
      <me>
        \frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v
      </me>
      is a first-order equation while
      <me>
        \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -10y
      </me>
      is a second-order equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      A differential equation is <em>autonomous</em>
          <idx><h>autonomous</h></idx> <idx><h>differential equation</h><h>autonomous</h></idx>
      if the independent
      variable does not appear in the description of the derivative.
      For instance,
      <me>
        \frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v
      </me>
      is autonomous because the description of the derivative <m>dv/dt</m> does
      not depend on time.
      The equation
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = 1.5t - 0.5y
      </me>,
      however, is not autonomous.
