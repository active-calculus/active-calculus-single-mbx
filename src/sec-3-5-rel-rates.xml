          If two quantities that are related,

          are both changing as implicit functions of time,
          how are their rates of change related?

      In most of our applications of the derivative so far,
      we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable,
      say <m>y</m>, changes with respect to another, say <m>x</m>,
      leading us to compute and interpret <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We next consider situations where several variable quantities are related,
      but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time,
      which will be represented by the variable <m>t</m>.
      Through knowing how the quantities are related,
      we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.

    <p permid="pdA">
      For example,
      suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second.
      Since the balloon's volume and radius are related,
      by knowing how fast the volume is changing,
      we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing.
      We are interested in questions such as:
      can we determine how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?

          All of these quantities are related to one another,

      Recognizing which geometric relationships are relevant in a given problem 
      is often the key to finding the function to optimize.
      For instance,
      although the problem in <xref ref="act-3-5-1">Activity</xref>
      is about a conical tank,
      the most important fact is that there are two similar right triangles involved.
      In another setting,
      we might use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle.
      But in the conical tank,
      the fact that the water fills the tank so that that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the important relationship.
      In other situations where a changing angle is involved,
      trigonometric functions may provide the means to find relationships among various parts of the triangle.

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-3-5-2.xml" />

    <p permid="yxm">
      In addition to finding instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time,
      we can often make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time.
      For instance,
      when a conical tank is filling with water at a constant rate,
      it seems obvious that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time.
      Note how carefully we must phrase the relationship:
      we mean to say that while the depth,
      <m>h</m>, of the water is increasing,
      its rate of change, <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>, is decreasing 
      (both as a function of <m>t</m> and as a function of <m>h</m>).
      We make this observation by solving the equation that relates the various rates for one particular rate,
      without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates.
      For instance,
      in the conical tank problem in <xref ref="act-3-5-1">Activity</xref>,
      we established that
      <me permid="gtI">
        \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
      </me>,
      and hence
      <me permid="MAR">
        \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{16}{\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="eEv">
      Provided that <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> is constant,
      it is immediately apparent that as <m>h</m> gets larger,
      <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m> will get smaller
      but remain positive.
      Hence, the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.

            When two or more related quantities are changing as implicit functions of time,
            their rates of change can be related by implicitly differentiating the equation that relates the quantities themselves.

            if the sides of a right triangle are all changing as functions of time,
            say having lengths <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>,

            so that if we know the values of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>,
            and <m>z</m> at a particular time,
            as well as two of the three rates,
            we can deduce the value of the third.
