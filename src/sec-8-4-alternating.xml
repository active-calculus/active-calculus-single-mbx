    <p permid="Bmb">
      So far, we've considered series with exclusively nonnegative terms.
      Next, we consider series that have some negative terms.
      For instance, the geometric series
      <me permid="kXK">
        2 - \frac{4}{3} + \frac{8}{9} - \cdots + 2 \left(-\frac{2}{3} \right)^n + \cdots
      </me>,
      has <m>a = 2</m> and <m>r = -\frac{2}{3}</m>,
      so that every other term alternates in sign.
      This series converges to
      <me permid="ReT">
        S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{2}{1- \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)} = \frac{6}{5}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="htk">
      In <xref ref="PA-8-4">Preview Activity</xref> and our following discussion,
      we investigate the behavior of similar series where consecutive terms have opposite signs.

    <p permid="ZOL">
      Using computational technology,
      we find that the sum of the first 100 terms in this series is 0.6881721793.
      As a comparison, <m>\ln(2) \approx 0.6931471806</m>.
      This shows that even though the series<nbsp /><xref ref="eq-ln-2" /> converges to <m>\ln(2)</m>,
      it must do so quite slowly,
      since the sum of the first 100 terms isn't particularly close to <m>\ln(2)</m>.
      We will investigate the issue of how quickly an alternating series converges later in this section.

          An alternating series is a series of the form

      We have some flexibility in how we write an alternating series;

      As we will soon see,
      there are several very nice results that hold for alternating series,
      while alternating series can also demonstrate some unusual behaivior.

      It is important to remember that most of the series tests we have seen in previous sections apply only to series with nonnegative terms.

      Conditionally convergent series turn out to be very interesting.
      If the sequence <m>\{a_n\}</m> decreases to 0, but the series <m>\sum a_k</m> diverges,
      the conditionally convergent series
      <m>\sum (-1)^k a_k</m> is right on the borderline of being a divergent series.
      As a result,
      any conditionally convergent series converges very slowly.
      Furthermore,
      some very strange things can happen with conditionally convergent series,
      as illustrated in some of the exercises.

      We have discussed several tests for convergence/divergence of series in our sections and in exercises.
      We close this section of the text with a summary of all the tests we have encountered,
      followed by an activity that challenges you to decide which convergence test to apply to several different series.

            An alternating series is a series whose terms alternate in sign.

            The sequence of partial sums of a convergent alternating series oscillates around the sum of the series if the sequence of <m>n</m>th terms converges to 0.
            That is why the Alternating Series Test shows that the alternating series
