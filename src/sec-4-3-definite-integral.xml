      We therefore explore the natural idea of allowing the number of rectangles to increase without bound.
      In an effort to compute the exact net signed area we also consider the differences among left, right,

      We begin with functions that are exclusively positive on the interval under consideration.

    <title>The definition of the definite integral</title>

    <p permid="OSU">
      In <xref ref="PA-4-3">Preview Activity</xref>,
      we saw that as the number of rectangles got larger and larger,
      the values of <m>L_n</m>, <m>M_n</m>,
      and <m>R_n</m> all grew closer and closer to the same value.
      It turns out that this occurs for any continuous function on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      and also for a Riemann sum using any point
      <m>x_{i+1}^*</m> in the interval <m>[x_i, x_{i+1}]</m>.
      Thus, as we let <m>n \to \infty</m>,
      it doesn't really matter where we choose to evaluate the function within a given subinterval, because
      <me permid="MIi">
        \lim_{n \to \infty} L_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} M_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="vad">
      That these limits always exist
      (and share the same value)
      when <m>f</m> is continuous<fn>
      It turns out that a function need not be continuous in order to have a definite integral.
      For our purposes,
      we assume that the functions we consider are continuous on the interval(s) of interest.
      It is straightforward to see that any function that is piecewise continuous on an interval of interest will also have a well-defined definite integral.
      </fn> allows us to make the following definition.

      The process of determining the real number <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m> is called
      <em>evaluating the definite integral</em>.
      While there are several different interpretations of the definite integral,

      We can also use definite integrals to express the change in position and the distance traveled by a moving object.
      If <m>v</m> is a velocity function on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      then the change in position of the object,
      <m>s(b) - s(a)</m>, is given by
      <me permid="FdJ">
        s(b) - s(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt

    <p permid="TCN">
      If the velocity function is nonnegative on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      then <m>\int_a^b v(t) \,dt</m> tells us the distance the object traveled.
      If the velocity is sometimes negative on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      we can use definite integrals to find the areas bounded by the function on each interval where <m>v</m> does not change sign,
      and the sum of these areas will tell us the distance the object traveled.
    </p>

    <p permid="zJW">
      To compute the value of a definite integral from the definition,
      we have to take the limit of a sum.
      While this is possible to do in select circumstances,
      it is also tedious and time-consuming,
      and does not offer much additional insight into the meaning or interpretation of the definite integral.
      Instead, in <xref ref="sec-4-4-FTC">Section</xref>,
      we will learn the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
      which provides a shortcut for evaluating a large class of definite integrals.
      This will enable us to determine the exact net signed area bounded by a continuous function and the <m>x</m>-axis in many circumstances.
    </p>

    <p permid="fRf">
      For now, our goal is to understand the meaning and properties of the definite integral,
      rather than to compute its value.
      To do this, we will rely on the net signed area interpretation of the definite integral.
      So we will use as examples curves that produce regions whose areas we can compute exactly through area formulas.
      We can thus compute the exact value of the corresponding integral.

      For instance,

      we observe that the region bounded by this function and the <m>x</m>-axis is the trapezoid shown in <xref ref="F-4-3-TrapArea">Figure</xref>.
      By the formula for the area of a trapezoid,
      <m>A = \frac{1}{2}(3+9) \cdot 3 = 18</m>, so

    <title>Some properties of the definite integral</title>

      Regarding the definite integral of a function <m>f</m> over an interval <m>[a,b]</m> as the net signed area bounded by <m>f</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis,
      we discover several standard properties of the definite integral.
      It is helpful to remember that the definite integral is defined in terms of Riemann sums,

      For any real number <m>a</m> and the definite integral

    <p permid="Bzj">
      There are two additional useful properties of the definite integral.
      When we worked with derivative rules in <xref ref="C-2">Chapter</xref>,
      we formulated the Constant Multiple Rule and the Sum Rule.
      Recall that the Constant Multiple Rule says that if <m>f</m> is a differentiable function and <m>k</m> is a constant, then
      <me permid="JNC">
        \frac{d}{dx} [kf(x)] = kf'(x)
      </me>,
      and the Sum Rule says that if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions, then
      <me permid="pUL">
        \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="hGs">
      These rules are useful because they allow to deal individually with the simplest parts of certain functions by taking advantage of addition and multiplying by a constant.
      In other words,
      the process of taking the derivative respects addition and multiplying by constants in the simplest possible way.
    </p>

    <p permid="NNB">
      It turns out that similar rules hold for the definite integral.
      First, let's consider the functions pictured in <xref ref="F-4-3-ConstMult">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-4-3-ConstMult" permid="KSV">

      <image width="100%" source="images/4_3_ConstMult" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="tUK">
      Because multiplying the function by 2 doubles its height at every <m>x</m>-value,
      we see that the height of each rectangle in a left Riemann sum is doubled,
      <m>f(x_i)</m> for the original function,
      versus <m>2f(x_i)</m> in the doubled function.
      For the areas <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
      it follows <m>B = 2A</m>.
      As this is true
      regardless of the value of <m>n</m> or the type of sum we use,
      we see that in the limit,
      the area of the red region bounded by
      <m>y = 2f(x)</m> will be twice the area of the blue region bounded by <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      As there is nothing special about the value <m>2</m> compared to an arbitrary constant <m>k</m>,
      the following general principle holds.

    <title>How the definite integral is connected to a function's average value</title>
    <idx><h>average value of a function</h></idx>

    <p permid="Xhn">
      One of the most valuable applications of the definite integral is that it provides a way to discuss the average value of a function,
      even for a function that takes on infinitely many values.
      Recall that if we wish to take the average of <m>n</m> numbers <m>y_1</m>,
      <m>y_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>y_n</m>, we compute
      <me permid="Oxv">
        AVG  = \frac{y_1 + y_2 + \cdots + y_n}{n}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Dow">
      Since integrals arise from Riemann sums in which we add <m>n</m> values of a function,
      it should not be surprising that evaluating an integral is similar to averaging the output values of a function.
      Consider, for instance,
      the right Riemann sum <m>R_n</m> of a function <m>f</m>,
      which is given by
      <me permid="uEE">
        R_n = f(x_1) \Delta x + f(x_2) \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_n) \Delta x = (f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n))\Delta x
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="jvF">
      Since <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}</m>, we can thus write
      <mdn permid="aLN">
        <mrow number="no">R_n =\mathstrut \amp (f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n))\cdot \frac{b-a}{n}</mrow>

    <p permid="PCO">
      We see that the right Riemann sum with <m>n</m> subintervals is just the length of the interval <m>(b-a)</m> times the average of the <m>n</m> function values found at the right endpoints.
      And just as with our efforts to compute area,
      the larger the value of <m>n</m> we use,
      the more accurate our average will be.
      Indeed, we will define the average value of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> to be
      <me permid="GSW">
        f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n)}{n}

      But we also know that for any continuous function <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      taking the limit of a Riemann sum leads precisely to the definite integral.
      That is, <m>\lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m>,
      and thus taking the limit as
      <m>n \to \infty</m> in <xref ref="E-RAvg">Equation</xref>,
      we have that

      Equation<nbsp /><xref ref="E-RAvg2" /> tells us another way to interpret the definite integral:
      the definite integral of a function <m>f</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> is the length of the interval <m>(b-a)</m> times the average value of the function on the interval.

      and at right these two figures superimposed.
      Note that in dark green we show the horizontal line <m>y = f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}</m>.
      Thus, the area of the green rectangle is given by <m>(b-a) \cdot f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}</m>,
      which is precisely the value of <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m>.
      The area of the blue region in the left figure is the same as the area of the green rectangle in the center figure.
      We can also observe that the areas <m>A_1</m> and <m>A_2</m> in the rightmost figure appear to be equal.
      Thus, knowing the average value of a function enables us to construct a rectangle whose area is the same as the value of the definite integral of the function on the interval.

            Any Riemann sum of a continuous function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> provides an estimate of the net signed area bounded by the function and the horizontal axis on the interval.
            Increasing the number of subintervals in the Riemann sum improves the accuracy of this estimate,
            and letting the number of subintervals increase without bound results in the values of the corresponding Riemann sums approaching the exact value of the enclosed net signed area.

            When we take the limit of Riemann sums,

            In particular, the symbol
            <m>\int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m> denotes the definite integral of <m>f</m> over <m>[a,b]</m>,

            The definite integral is a sophisticated sum,
            and thus has some of the same natural properties that finite sums have.
            Perhaps most important of these is how the definite integral respects sums and constant multiples of functions,
            which can be summarized by the rule
            <me permid="fvG">
              \int_a^b [c f(x) \pm k g(x)] \,dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \,dx \pm k \int_a^b g(x) \,dx
