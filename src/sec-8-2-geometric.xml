  <introduction>
    <p>
      Many important sequences are generated by addition.
      In <xref ref="PA-8-2">Preview Activity</xref>,
      we see an example of a sequence that is connected to a sum.

  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Geometric Series</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-8-2">Preview Activity</xref> we encountered the sum
      <me>
        (5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3+ \cdots + 0.08^{n-1}\right)
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
     for the long-term level of Warfarin in the patient's system.
      This sum has the form
      <men xml:id="eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric-1">
        a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}
      </men>
      where <m>a=5 \times 0.08</m> and <m>r=0.08</m>.
      Such a sum is called a <em>finite geometric series</em>
          <idx><h>finite geometric series</h></idx>
      with ratio <m>r</m>.
      
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8-2-1.xml" />

    <p>
      The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a <em>series</em>. We summarize the result of <xref ref="act-8-2-1">Activity</xref> in the following way.
    </p>

      <assemblage>
      <p>
        A finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> is a sum of the form
        <men xml:id="eq-8-2-geometric-sum">
          S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}
        </men>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers such that <m>r \ne 1</m>.
        The finite geometric series <m>S_n</m> can be written more simply as
        <men xml:id="eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric">
          S_n = a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}
        </men>.
      </p>      
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      We now apply Equation <xref ref="eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric" /> to the example involving Warfarin from <xref ref="PA-8-2">Preview Activity</xref>.
      Recall that
      <me>
        Q(n)=(5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3+ \cdots + 0.08^{n-1}\right) \text{mg}
      </me>,
      so <m>Q(n)</m> is a geometric series with <m>a=5 \times 0.08 = 0.4</m> and <m>r = 0.08</m>.
      Thus,
      <me>
        Q(n) = 0.4\left(\frac{1-0.08^n}{1-0.08}\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that as <m>n</m> goes to infinity,
      the value of <m>0.08^n</m> goes to 0.
      So,
      <me>
        \lim_{n \to \infty} Q(n) = \lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \approx 0.435
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, the long-term level of Warfarin in the blood under these conditions is <m>\frac{1}{2.3}</m>,
      which is approximately 0.435 mg.
    </p>

    <p>
      To determine the long-term effect of Warfarin,
      we considered a finite geometric series of <m>n</m> terms,
      and then considered what happened as <m>n</m> was allowed to grow without bound.
      In this sense,
      we were actually interested in an infinite geometric series (the result of letting <m>n</m> go to infinity in the finite sum).

    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An infinite geometric series is an infinite sum of the form
          <men xml:id="eq-8-2-geometric-series">
            a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n
          </men>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The value of <m>r</m> in the geometric series <xref ref="eq-8-2-geometric-series" /> is called the <em>common ratio</em>
          <idx><h>geometric series</h><h>common ratio</h></idx>
      of the series because the ratio of the (<m>n+1</m>)st term, <m>ar^n</m>, to the <m>n</m>th term, <m>ar^{n-1}</m>, is always <m>r</m>:
      <me>
        \frac{ar^n}{ar^{n-1}} = r
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Geometric series are common in mathematics and arise naturally in many different situations.
      As a familiar example,
      suppose we want to write the number with repeating decimal expansion
      <me>
        N=0.1212\overline{12}
      </me>
      as a rational number.
      Observe that
      <md>
        <mrow>N \amp =  0.12 + 0.0012 + 0.000012 + \cdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \left(\frac{12}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 + \cdots</mrow>
      </md>.
      This is an infinite geometric series with
      <m>a=\frac{12}{100}</m> and <m>r = \frac{1}{100}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>  
      By using the formula for the value of a finite geometric sum,
      we can also develop a formula for the value of an infinite geometric series.
      We explore this idea in the following activity.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8-2-2.xml" />

    <p>
      We can now find the value of the geometric series 
      <me>
        N = \left(\frac{12}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 + \cdots
      </me>.
      Using <m>a = \frac{12}{100}</m> and <m>r = \frac{1}{100}</m>,
      we see that
      <me>
        N = \frac{12}{100} \left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{100}}\right) = \frac{12}{100} \left(\frac{100}{99}\right) = \frac{4}{33}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sum of a finite number of terms of an infinite geometric series is often called a <em>partial sum</em>
          <idx><h>partial sum</h></idx>
      of the series.
      Thus,
      <me>
        S_n = a+ar+ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k
      </me>.
    is called the <m>n</m>th partial sum of the series <m>\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k</m>. We summarize our recent work with geometric series as follows.

              it follows that the sum <m>S</m> of the infinite geometric series <xref ref="eq-8-2-geometric-series-2" /> is

                S = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r}
