  <introduction>
    <p>Many important sequences are generated through the process of addition. In <xref ref="PA-8-2">Preview Activity</xref>, we see a particular example of a special type of sequence that is connected to a sum.</p>

  <xi:include href="./previews/PA-8-2.xml" />

  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Geometric Sums</title>
    <p>In <xref ref="PA-8-2">Preview Activity</xref> we encountered the sum
      <me>
        (5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3+ \cdots + 0.08^{n-1}\right)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>In order to evaluate the long-term level of Warfarin in the patient's system, we will want to fully understand the sum in this expression. This sum has the form
      <men xml:id="eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric-1" >
        a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}
      </men>
    where <m>a=5 \times 0.08</m> and <m>r=0.08</m>. Such a sum is called a <em>geometric sum</em><idx><h>geometric sum</h></idx> with ratio <m>r</m>. We will analyze this sum in more detail in the next activity.</p>

  <xi:include href="./activities/act-8-2-1.xml" />

    <p>We can summarize the result of <xref ref="act-8-2-1">Activity</xref> in the following way.</p>

    <p>A geometric sum <m>S_n</m> is a sum of the form
      <men xml:id="eq-8-2-geometric-sum" >
        S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}
      </men>,
    where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers such that <m>r \ne 1</m>. The geometric sum <m>S_n</m> can be written more simply as
      <men xml:id="eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric" >
        S_n = a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p>We now apply equation <xref ref="eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric" /> to the example involving warfarin from <xref ref="PA-8-2">Preview Activity</xref>. Recall that
      <me>
        Q(n)=(5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3+ \cdots + 0.08^{n-1}\right) \text{mg}
      </me>,
    so <m>Q(n)</m> is a geometric sum with <m>a=5 \times 0.08 = 0.4</m> and <m>r = 0.08</m>. Thus,
      <me>
        Q(n) = 0.4\left(\frac{1-0.08^n}{1-0.08}\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>Notice that as <m>n</m> goes to infinity, the value of <m>0.08^n</m> goes to 0. So,
      <me>
        \lim_{n \to \infty} Q(n) = \lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \approx 0.435
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>Therefore, the long-term level of Warfarin in the blood under these conditions is <m>\frac{1}{2.3}</m>, which is approximately 0.435 mg.</p>

    <p>To determine the long-term effect of Warfarin, we considered a geometric sum of <m>n</m> terms, and then considered what happened as <m>n</m> was allowed to grow without bound. In this sense, we were actually interested in an infinite geometric sum (the result of letting <m>n</m> go to infinity in the finite sum). We call such an infinite geometric sum a <em>geometric series</em>. <idx><h>geometric series</h></idx> <idx><h>series</h><h>geometric</h></idx></p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>A geometric series is an infinite sum of the form
          <men xml:id="eq-8-2-geometric-series" >
            a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n
          </men>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>The value of <m>r</m> in the geometric series <xref ref="eq-8-2-geometric-series" /> is called the <em>common ratio</em> <idx><h>geometric series</h><h>common ratio</h></idx> of the series because the ratio of the (<m>n+1</m>)st term <m>ar^n</m> to the <m>n</m>th term <m>ar^{n-1}</m> is always <m>r</m>.</p>

    <p>Geometric series are very common in mathematics and arise naturally in many different situations. As a familiar example, suppose we want to write the number with repeating decimal expansion
      <me>
        N=0.1212\overline{12}
      </me>
    as a rational number. Observe that
      <md>
        <mrow>N \amp =  0.12 + 0.0012 + 0.000012 + \cdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \left(\frac{12}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 + \cdots</mrow>
      </md>,
    which is an infinite geometric series with <m>a=\frac{12}{100}</m> and <m>r = \frac{1}{100}</m>. In the same way that we were able to find a shortcut formula for the value of a (finite) geometric sum, we would like to develop a formula for the value of a (infinite) geometric series. We explore this idea in the following activity.</p>

  <xi:include href="./activities/act-8-2-2.xml" />

    <p>From our work in <xref ref="act-8-2-2">Activity</xref>, we can now find the value of the geometric series <m>N = \left(\frac{12}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 + \cdots</m>. In particular, using <m>a = \frac{12}{100}</m> and <m>r = \frac{1}{100}</m>, we see that
      <me>
        N = \frac{12}{100} \left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{100}}\right) = \frac{12}{100} \left(\frac{100}{99}\right) = \frac{4}{33}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>It is important to notice that a geometric sum is simply the sum of a finite number of terms of a geometric series. In other words, the geometric sum <m>S_n</m> for the geometric series
      <me>
        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k
      </me>
    is
      <me>
        S_n = a+ar+ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>We also call this sum <m>S_n</m> the <m>n</m>th <em>partial sum</em><idx><h>partial sum</h></idx> of the geometric series. We summarize our recent work with geometric series as follows.</p>

        <p>A geometric series is an infinite sum of the form
          <men xml:id="eq-8-2-geometric-series-2" >
            a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n
          </men>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> are real numbers such that <m>r \ne 0</m>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The <m>n</m>th partial sum <m>S_n</m> of the geometric series is
          <me>
            S_n = a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If <m>|r| \lt  1</m>, then using the fact that <m>S_n = a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}</m>, it follows that the sum <m>S</m> of the geometric series <xref ref="eq-8-2-geometric-series-2" /> is
          <me>
            S = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r}
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
