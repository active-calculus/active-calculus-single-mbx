          This Solutions Manual for <pubtitle>Active Calculus</pubtitle> is organized by section.
          Preview Activity solutions are not provided,
          but each activity within a section has a solution provided.
          The solution to each activity starts at the top of a new page,
          so instructors can easily extract the solution for a single activity if they wish to print it for students or post on their course's learning management system site.
          After the activity solutions come the exercise solutions.
          Solutions for
          <webwork /> exercises are not provided,
          since those solutions are automatically available in this book's <init>HTML</init> version.
          Each exercise also starts at the top of its own page to make it easy to extract only the solutions to certain exercises.
        </p>

        <p permid="nXh">
          Please do not post this solutions manual publicly on the internet nor in any electronic form where it is available in full to students.
          As much as possible,
          we aspire to keep this solutions manual as a resource for instructors only so that students get the full benefit of activities and exercises by having to struggle with them without looking at solutions.
        </p>

        <p permid="Ueq">
          By extracting individual pages from the <init>PDF</init>,
          it is fine to share solutions to individual activities or exercises via course management system software.
          Please do not post these individual pages publicly on the internet.
