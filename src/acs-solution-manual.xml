                <p>This Solution Manual for <pubtitle>Active Calculus</pubtitle> is organized by section. Preview Activity solutions are not provided, but each activity within a section has a solution provided. The solution to each activity starts at the top of a new page, so instructors can easily extract the solution for a single activity if they wish to print it for students or post on their course's learning management system site. After the activity solutions come the exercise solutions. Solutions for <webwork /> exercises are not provided, since those solutions are automatically available in this book's <init>HTML</init> version. Each exercise also starts at the top of its own page to make it easy to extract only the solutions to certain exercises.</p>
