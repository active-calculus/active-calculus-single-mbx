        We encounter sequences every day.
        Your monthly utility payments,
        the annual interest you earn on investments,
        the amount you spend on groceries each week;
        all are examples of sequences.
        Other sequences with which you may be familiar include the Fibonacci sequence
            <idx><h>Fibonacci sequence</h></idx>
        <m> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots </m> in which each entry is the sum of the two preceding entries,
        and the triangular numbers<idx><h>triangular numbers</h></idx>
        <m> 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \ldots </m> the number of vertices in the triangles shown in <xref ref="F-8-1-Triangular-numbers">Figure</xref>.

      Sequences of integers are of such interest to mathematicians and others that they have a journal<fn><booktitle>The Journal of Integer Sequences</booktitle> at <url href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/" /></fn>devoted to them and an on-line encyclopedia<fn>The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences at <url href="http://oeis.org/" /></fn>that catalogs a huge number of integer sequences and their connections.
      Sequences are also used in digital recordings and images.

      Our studies in calculus have dealt with continuous continuous functions.
      Sequences model <em>discrete</em>
      instead of continuous information.
      We will study ways to represent and work with discrete information in this chapter as we investigate
      <em>sequences</em> and <em>series</em>,
      and ultimately see key connections between the discrete and continuous.

    <title>Sequences</title>
    <idx><h>sequence</h></idx>

    <p>
      As <xref ref="PA-8-1">Preview Activity</xref> illustrates,
      many discrete phenomena can be represented as lists of numbers (like the amount of money in an account over a period of months).
      We call any such list a <em>sequence</em>.
      A sequence is nothing more than list of terms in some order.
      We often list the entries of the sequence with subscripts,
      <me>
        s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \ldots
      </me>,
      where the subscript denotes the position of the entry in the sequence.
      
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="D-8-1-sequence">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A sequence is a list of terms
          <m>s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots</m> in a specified order.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We can think of a sequence as a function <m>f</m> whose domain is the set of positive integers where 
      <m>f(n) = s_n</m> for each positive integer <m>n</m>.
      This alternative view will be be useful in many situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      We often denote the sequence
      <me>
        s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots
      </me>
      by <m>\{s_n\}</m>.
      The value <m>s_n</m> (alternatively <m>s(n)</m>) is called the <m>n</m>th <em>term</em>
          <idx><h>sequence</h><h>term</h></idx>
      in the sequence.
      If the terms are all 0 after some fixed value of <m>n</m>,
      we say the sequence is finite.
      Otherwise the sequence is infinite.
      With infinite sequences,
      we are often interested in their end behavior and the idea of
      <em>convergent</em> sequences.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8-1-1.xml" />

    <p>
      Next we formalize the ideas from <xref ref="act-8-1-1">Activity</xref>.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-8-1-2.xml" />

    <p>
      In <xref ref="act-8-1-1">Activities</xref>
      and <xref ref="act-8-1-2"></xref>
      we investigated a sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> which has a limit as <m>n</m> goes to infinity.
      We say that the sequence <em>converges</em>.
          <idx><h>converge</h><h>sequence</h></idx> or is a
      <em>convergent sequence</em><idx><h>convergent sequence</h></idx>
      If the limit of a convergent sequence is the number <m>L</m>,
      we write
      <me>
        \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = L
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> does not converge, we say that the sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> <em>diverges</em>.
          <idx><h>diverge</h><h>sequence</h></idx>
      Here is a formal definition of convergence.
    </p>

    <p>
      A sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> of real numbers converges to a number <m>L</m> if we can make all values of <m>s_k</m> for <m>k \ge n</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we want by choosing <m>n</m> to be sufficiently large.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea of sequence having a limit as
      <m>n \to \infty</m> is the same as the idea of a continuous function having a limit as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
      The only difference is that our sequences are discrete instead of continuous.

        <li>
          <p>
            A sequence is a list of objects in a specified order.
            We will typically work with sequences of real numbers. We can think of a sequence as a function from the positive integers to the set of real numbers.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            A sequence <m>\{s_n\}</m> of real numbers converges to a number <m>L</m> if we can make every value of <m>s_k</m> for <m>k \ge n</m> as close as we want to <m>L</m> by choosing <m>n</m> sufficiently large.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            A sequence diverges if it does not converge.
