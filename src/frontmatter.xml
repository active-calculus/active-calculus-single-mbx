      This text began as my sabbatical project in the winter semester of 2012,
      during which I wrote most of the material for the first four chapters.
      For the sabbatical leave, I am indebted to Grand Valley State University for its support of the project,
      as well as to my colleagues in the Department of Mathematics and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for their endorsement of the project.
      I'm also grateful to the American Institute of Mathematics
      for their <url href="https://aimath.org/textbooks/">support of free and open textbooks in general</url>,
      and their support of this one in particular.
    </p>

    <p permid="sVv">
      The beautiful full-color .eps graphics in the text are only possible because of David Austin of GVSU and Bill Casselman of the University of British Columbia.
      Building on their longstanding efforts to develop tools for high quality mathematical graphics, David wrote a library of Python routines that employ <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/bi">Bill's PiScript program</url>; 
      David's routines are so easy to use that even I could generate graphics like the professionals that he and Bill are.
      I am deeply grateful to them both.

    <p permid="ZcE">
      The current .html version of the text is possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of the original Mathbook XML,
      now known as <url href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</url>.
      My ability to take advantage of Rob's work is due in large part 
      to the support of the American Institute of Mathematics,
      which funded me to attend a weeklong workshop in Mathbook XML in San Jose, CA, 
      in April 2016, as well as 
      the support of the ongoing
      <url href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pretext-support">user group</url>.  A subsequent 
      workshop in June 2019 has offered further support and more improvements to the text.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      David Farmer's conversion script saved me hundreds of hours of work by taking my original <latex /> source and converting it to <pretext />; David remains a major source of ongoing support and advocacy.
      Alex Jordan of Portland Community College has also been a tremendous help,
      and it is through Alex's fantastic work that live
      <webwork /> exercises are not only possible,
      but also included from the 2017 version forward.
      Mitch Keller of Morningside College agreed in early 2018 to serve as the book's production editor; 
      his technical expertise has contributed to many aspects of the book,
      including the presence of answers to
      activities and non-
      <webwork /> exercises and other supporting material for instructors.
    </p>

    <p permid="FjN">
      For the 2018 edition, Kathy Yoshiwara of the AIM Editorial Board read the entire text and contributed 
      editorial suggestions for every section.
      In short, she made the prose cleaner,
      more direct, and simply better.
      I'm deeply thankful for her time, effort, and insights.

    <p permid="lqW">
      Over my more than 20 years at GVSU, many of my colleagues have shared with me ideas and 
      resources for teaching calculus.
      I am particularly indebted to David Austin, Will Dickinson, Paul Fishback, Jon Hodge,
      and Steve Schlicker for their contributions that improved my teaching of and thinking about calculus,
      including materials that I have modified and used over many different semesters with students.
      Parts of these ideas can be found throughout this text.
      In addition, Will Dickinson and Steve Schlicker provided me access to a large number of their electronic notes and activities from teaching of differential and integral calculus,
      and those ideas and materials have similarly impacted my work and writing in positive ways,
      with some of their problems and approaches finding parallel presentation here.
    </p>

    <p permid="Ryf">
      In the summer of 2012, David and Steve each agreed to write a chapter to support the completion 
      of the material on integral calculus. 
      David is the lead author of <xref ref="C-7">Chapter</xref>
      and Steve the lead author of <xref ref="C-8">Chapter</xref>.
      Along with our colleague Ted Sundstrom, Steve has also contributed a large number of problem and 
      activity solutions and answers.
      I'm especially grateful for how the work of these friends and colleagues
      has made the text so much better.
    </p>

    <p permid="xFo">
      Shelly Smith of GVSU and Matt Delong of Marian University both provided extensive comments on the first few chapters of early drafts,
      feedback that was immensely helpful in improving the text.
      As more and more people use the text, I am grateful to everyone who reads,
      edits, and uses this book,
      and hence contributes to its improvement through ongoing discussion.
    </p>

    <p permid="dMx">
      Finally, I am grateful for all that my students have taught me over the years.
      Their responses and feedback have helped to shape me as a teacher,
      and I appreciate their willingness to wholeheartedly engage in the activities and approaches I've tried in class,
      to let me know how those affect their learning,
      and to help me learn and grow as an instructor.
      Early on, they also provided useful editorial feedback on this text.
    </p>

    <p permid="JTG">
      Any and all remaining errors or inconsistencies are mine.
      I will gladly take <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0vK">reader and user feedback</url> 
      to correct them, along with other suggestions to improve the text.

    <title>Active Calculus: Our Goals</title>
    <p permid="PIS">
      Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old.
      As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics,
      calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s,
      with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.
      The subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed.
      As a body of knowledge,
      calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years.
      The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements:
      among many spectacular ideas,
      calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance,
      explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes,
      enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities,
      and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.
    </p>

    <p permid="vQb">
      While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject,
      it is hardly the case that many of the ideas they present are new.
      Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are,
      as well as their justification and their importance.
      In the 21st century and the age of the internet, 
      no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read,
      to use for a class,
      or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve.
      Calculus belongs to humankind,
      not any individual author or publishing company.
      Thus, a primary purpose of this work is to present a calculus text that is <em>free</em>.
      See <url href="https://activecalculus.org">https://activecalculus.org</url> for links to both 
      the .html and .pdf versions of the text.
      In addition,
      instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit;
      thus this text is <em>open-source</em>.
      See <url href="https://github.com/active-calculus/active-calculus-single-mbx">GitHub</url> 
      for the <PreTeXt /> source.
      Since August 2013, <em>Active Calculus - Single Variable</em>
      has been endorsed by the American Institute of Mathematics and its 
      <url href="http://aimath.org/textbooks">Open Textbook Initiative</url>.
    </p>

    <p permid="bXk">
      In <pubtitle>Active Calculus - Single Variable</pubtitle>,
      we actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are generated by students.
      Where many texts present a general theory followed by substantial collections of worked examples,
      we instead pose problems or situations,
      consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore.
      Following key activities or examples,
      the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties,
      followed by formal statements of rules or theorems.
      While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results,
      rarely do we include formal proofs.
      It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate
      to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true,
      but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive,
      leading manner that enables them to begin to understand calculus for themselves.
      This approach is consistent with the
      <url href="http://launchings.blogspot.com/2011/07/the-worst-way-to-teach.html">scholarly consensus</url>
      that calls for students to be interactively engaged in class.
    </p>

    <p permid="Iet">
      Moreover, this approach is consistent with the following goals:

      <ul permid="CKG">
        <li permid="vgh">
          <p permid="JjM">
            To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach,
            where learners construct solutions and approaches to ideas,
            with appropriate support through questions posed, hints,
            and guidance from the instructor and text.

          <p permid="pqV">
            To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in calculus are natural and true.
            Often we do this through consideration of the instantaneous position and velocity of a moving object.

          <p permid="ahX">
            There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises.
            Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text,
            we recommend the use of
            <webwork />
            with its access to the Open Problem Library and around 20,000 calculus problems.
            In this text,
            each section includes a small number of anonymous
            <webwork />
            exercises,
            as well as 3<ndash />4 challenging problems per section.
            The
            <webwork />
            exercises are best completed in
            <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/">the .html version of the text</url>,
            as this provides students with immediate feedback without penalty.
            Almost every non-
            <webwork />
            exercise has multiple parts,
            requires the student to connect several key ideas,
            and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings.
            For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises,
            consider the freely available <pubtitle>APEX Calculus</pubtitle> text by Greg Hartmann et al., available from

The first two formats are free.  If you are going to use the book electronically, the best mode is the <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/">HTML</url>.  The HTML version looks great in any browser, including on a smartphone, and the links are much easier to navigate in HTML than in PDF.  Some particular direct suggestions about using the HTML follow among the next few paragraphs; alternatively, you can <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14i">watch this short video from the author</url>.  It is also wise to download and save the PDF, since you can use the PDF offline, while the HTML version requires an internet connection.  A print copy costs about $21 via <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14n">Amazon</url>.

      This book is intended to be read sequentially and engaged with, much more than to be used as a lookup reference.  For example, each section begins with a short introduction and a Preview Activity; you should read the short introduction and complete the Preview Activity prior to class.  Your instructor may require you to do this.  Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15-20 minutes and are intended to be accessible based on the understanding you have from preceding sections.  There are not answers provided to Preview Activities, as these are designed simply to get you thinking about ideas that will be helpful in work on upcoming new material.  
    </p>

    <p>
      As you use the book, think of it as a workbook, not a worked-book.  There is a great deal of scholarship that shows people learn better when they interactively engage and struggle with ideas themselves, rather than passively watch others.  Thus, instead of reading worked examples or watching an instructor complete examples, you will engage with Activities that prompt you to grapple with concepts and develop deep understanding.  You should expect to spend time in class working with peers on Activities and getting feedback from them and from your instructor.  You can purchase a separate Activities Workbook from Amazon (<url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14l">Chapters 1-4</url>, <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14m">Chapters 5-8</url>) in which to record your work on the activities, or you can ask your instructor for a copy of the PDF file that has only the activities along with room to record your work.  Your goal should be to do all of the activities in the relevant sections of the text and keep a careful record of your work.  You can find answers to the activities <xref ref="activities-answers">in the back matter</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each section concludes with a Summary.  Reading the Summary after you have read the section and worked the Activities is a good way to find a short list of key ideas that are most essential to take from the section.  A good study habit is to write similar summaries in your own words.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of each section, you'll find two types of Exercises.  First, there are several anonymous <webwork /> exercises.  These are online, interactive exercises that allow you to submit answers for immediate feedback with unlimited attempts without penalty; to submit answers, you have to be using the HTML version of the text (see <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14i">this short video on the HTML version that includes a <webwork /> demonstration</url>).  You should use these exercises as a way to test your understanding of basic ideas in the preceding section.  If your institution uses <webwork />, you may also need to log in to a server as directed by your instructor to complete assigned <webwork /> sets as part of your course grade.  The <webwork /> exercises included in this text are ungraded and not connected to any individual account.  Following the <webwork /> exercises there are 3-4 additional challenging exercises that are designed to encourage you to connect ideas, investigate new situations, and write about your understanding.  There are answers to most of the non-<webwork /> exercises <xref ref="exercises-answers">in the back matter</xref>.

      You can find additional support for your work in learning calculus from the <url href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-">GVSU Math 201 YouTube  Channel</url> and <url href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bIjQJDwfGtewW75Nw7PnGNSkfqwAm3v">GVSU Math 202 YouTube Channel</url> where there are several short video tutorials for each section of the text, numbered in alignment with the textbook sections.  Math 201 corresponds to Chapters 1-4 and Math 202 to Chapters 5-8; there are about 90 videos for each, totally more than 180.

      The best way to be successful in mathematics generally and calculus specifically is to strive to make sense of the main ideas.  We make sense of ideas by asking questions, interacting with others, attempting to solve problems, making mistakes, revising attempts, and writing and speaking about our understanding.  This text has been designed to help you make sense of calculus; we wish you the very best as you undertake the large and challenging task of doing so.

      This book is different.  Before you read further, first read <xref ref="preface-for-students" text="title"><q>Students! Read this!</q></xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chapters 1-4 are designed to correspond to what is often called differential calculus.  Chapters 5-8 correspond roughtly to what is often called integral calculus, including chapters on differential equations and infinite series.

      Among the three formats (HTML, PDF, print), the HTML is optimal for display in class if you have a suitable projector.  The HTML is also best for navigation, as links to internal and external references are much more obvious.  We recommend saving a downloaded version of the PDF format as a backup in the event you don't have internet access.  It's a good idea for each student to have a printed version of the Activities Workbook, which is available on Amazon (<url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14l">Chapters 1-4</url>, <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14m">Chapters 5-8</url>) or as a PDF document by direct request to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu); many instructors use the PDF to have coursepacks printed for students to purchase from their local bookstore.

      The text is written so that, on average, one section corresponds to two hours of class meeting time.  A typical instructional sequence when starting a new section might look like the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
             Students complete a Preview Activity in advance of class.  Class begins with a short debrief among peers followed by all class discussion.  (5-10 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
             Brief lecture and discussion to build on the preview activity and set the stage for the next activity. (5-10 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
             Students engage with peers to work on and discuss the first activity in the section. (15-20 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
             Brief discussion and possibly lecture to reach closure on the preceding activity, followed by transition to new ideas.  (Varies, but 5-15 minutes)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Possibly begin next activity.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The next hour of class would be similar, but without the Preview Activity to complete prior to class: the principal focus of class will be completing 2 activities.  Then rinse and repeat.
    </p>

    <p>
      We recommend that instructors use appropriate incentives to encourage students to complete Preview Activities prior to class.  Having these be part of completion-based assignments that count 5% of the semester grade usually results in the vast majority of students completing the vast majority of the previews.  If you'd like to see a sample syllabus for how to organize a course and weight various assignments, you can request one via email to the author.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the <webwork /> exercises in the HTML version are anonymous and there's not a way to track students' engagement with them.  These are intended to be formative for students and provide them with immediate feedback without penalty.  If your institution is a <webwork /> user, we have existing sets of .def files that correspond to the sections in the text; these are available upon request to the author.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <xref ref="backmatter" text="title">back matter of the text</xref>, you'll find answers to the Activities and to non-<webwork /> Exercises.  Instructors interested in solutions to these should contact the author directly.
