      So far, each infinite series we have discussed has been a series of real numbers, such as
      <men xml:id="E-geom12" permid="jbt">
        1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^k} + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k}
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="gCm">
      In the remainder of this chapter,
      we will include series that involve a variable.
      For instance,
      if in the geometric series in <xref ref="E-geom12">Equation</xref>
      we replace the ratio <m>r = \frac{1}{2}</m> with the variable <m>x</m>,
      we have the infinite
      (still geometric)
      series
      <men xml:id="E-geomx" permid="PiC">
        1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x^k
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="MJv">
      Here we see something very interesting:
      because a geometric series converges whenever its ratio <m>r</m> satisfies <m>|r|\lt 1</m>,
      and the sum of a convergent geometric series is <m>\frac{a}{1-r}</m>,
      we can say that for <m>|x| \lt  1</m>,
      <men xml:id="E-geomxsummed" permid="vpL">
        1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-x}
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p permid="sQE">
      <xref ref="E-geomxsummed">Equation</xref> states that
      the non-polynomial function
      <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> on the right is equal to the infinite polynomial expresssion on the left.
      Because the terms on the left
      get very small as <m>k</m> gets large,
      we can truncate the series
      and say, for example, that
      <me permid="bwU">
        1 + x + x^2 + x^3 \approx \frac{1}{1-x}
      </me>
      for small values of <m>x</m>.
      This shows one way that a polynomial function can be used to approximate a non-polynomial function;
      such approximations are one of the main themes in this section and the next.

      In <xref ref="PA-8-5">Preview Activity</xref>,

    <p permid="FeW">
      <xref ref="PA-8-5">Preview Activity</xref>
      illustrates the first steps in the process of approximating functions with polynomials.
      Using this process we can approximate trigonometric, exponential,
      logarithmic,
      and other nonpolynomial functions as closely as we like
      (for certain values of <m>x</m>)
      with polynomials.
      This is extraordinarily useful in that it allows us to calculate values of these functions to whatever precision we like using only the operations of addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, and division,
      which can be easily programmed in a computer.
    </p>

    <p permid="lmf">
      We next extend the approach in <xref ref="PA-8-5">Preview Activity</xref>
      to arbitrary functions at arbitrary points.
      Let <m>f</m> be a function that has as many derivatives as we need at a point <m>x=a</m>.
      Recall that <m>P_1(x)</m> is the tangent line to <m>f</m> at
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> and is given by the formula
      <me permid="HEd">
        P_1(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)
      </me>.
      <m>P_1(x)</m> is the linear approximation to <m>f</m> near <m>a</m> that has the same slope and function value as <m>f</m> at the point <m>x = a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Rto">
      We next want to find a quadratic approximation
      <me permid="nLm">
        P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2(x-a)^2
      </me>
      so that <m>P_2(x)</m> more closely models <m>f(x)</m> near <m>x=a</m>.
      Consider the following calculations of the values and derivatives of <m>P_2(x)</m>:
    </p>

    <p permid="xAx">
      <md permid="TSv">
        <mrow>P_2(x) \amp = P_1(x) + c_2(x-a)^2  \amp P_2(a) \amp = P_1(a) = f(a)</mrow>
        <mrow>P'_2(x) \amp = P'_1(x) + 2c_2(x-a) \amp P'_2(a) \amp = P'_1(a) = f'(a)</mrow>
        <mrow>P''_2(x) \amp = 2c_2               \amp P''_2(a) \amp = 2c_2</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="dHG">
      To make <m>P_2(x)</m> fit <m>f(x)</m> better than <m>P_1(x)</m>,
      we want <m>P_2(x)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> to have the same concavity at <m>x=a</m>,
      in addition to having the same slope and function value.
      That is, we want to have
      <me permid="zZE">
        P''_2(a) = f''(a)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JOP">
      This implies that
      <me permid="ggN">
        2c_2 = f''(a)
      </me>
      and thus
      <me permid="MnW">
        c_2 = \frac{f''(a)}{2}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pVY">
      Therefore, the quadratic approximation <m>P_2(x)</m> to <m>f</m> centered at <m>x=a</m> is
      <me permid="svf">
        P_2(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Wdh">
      This approach extends naturally to polynomials of higher degree.
      We define polynomials

      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Ckq">
      The defining property of these polynomials is that for each <m>n</m>,
      <m>P_n(x)</m> and all its first <m>n</m> derivatives must agree with those of <m>f</m> at <m>x = a</m>.
      In other words we require that

      </me>
      for all <m>k</m> from 0 to <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="irz">
      To see the conditions under which this happens, suppose
      <me permid="QXP">

        <mrow>P^{(5)}_n(a) \amp = (2)(3)(4)(5)c_5</mrow>
      </md>
      and, in general,

        P^{(k)}_n(a) = (2)(3)(4) \cdots (k-1)(k)c_k = k!c_k
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="uFR">
      So having
      <m>
      P^{(k)}_n(a) = f^{(k)}(a)

      means that

      k!c_k = f^{(k)}(a)

      for each value of <m>k</m>.
      Using this expression for <m>c_k</m>,
      we have found the formula for the polynomial approximation of <m>f</m> that we seek.

            The <m>n</m>th order Taylor polynomial centered at <m>a</m> for <m>f</m> is the <m>n</m>th partial sum of its Taylor series centered at <m>a</m>.
            So the <m>n</m>th order Taylor polynomial for a function <m>f</m> is an approximation to <m>f</m> on the interval where the Taylor series converges;
            for the values of <m>x</m> for which the Taylor series converges to <m>f</m> we write
            <me permid="LSx">
              f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k

            The Lagrange Error Bound shows us how to determine the accuracy in using a Taylor polynomial to approximate a function.
            More specifically,
            if <m>P_n(x)</m> is the <m>n</m>th order Taylor polynomial for <m>f</m> centered at <m>x=a</m> and if <m>M</m> is an upper bound for
            <m>\left|f^{(n+1)}(x)\right|</m> on the interval <m>[a, c]</m>, then
