      Much of mathematics centers on the notion of function.
      Indeed, throughout our study of calculus,
      we are investigating the behavior of functions,
      with particular emphasis on how fast the output of the function changes in response to changes in the input.
      Because each function represents a process,
      a natural question to ask is whether or not the particular process can be reversed.
      That is, if we know the output that results from the function,
      can we determine the input that led to it?
      And
      if we know how fast a particular process is changing,
      can we determine how fast the inverse process is changing?
    </p>

    <p permid="lks">
      One of the most important functions in all of mathematics is the natural exponential function <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.
      Its inverse, the natural logarithm,
      <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m>, is similarly important.
      One of our goals in this section is to learn how to differentiate the logarithm function.
      First, we review some of the basic concepts surrounding functions and their inverses.

      A function

      <m>f : A \to B</m> is a rule that associates each element in the set <m>A</m> to one and only one element in the set <m>B</m>.
      We call <m>A</m> the <em>domain</em>

      We often use the notation <m>f^{-1}</m>

      The last fact reveals a special relationship between the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      If a point <m>(x,y)</m> that lies on the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      then it is also true that <m>x = f^{-1}(y)</m>,
      which means that the point <m>(y,x)</m> lies on the graph of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      This shows us that the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m> are the reflections of each other across the line <m>y = x</m>,
      because this reflection is precisely the geometric action that swaps the coordinates in an ordered pair.
      In <xref ref="F-2-6-Inverse-Plot">Figure</xref>,
      we see this illustrated by the function <m>y = f(x) = 2^x</m> and its inverse,
      with the points <m>(-1,\frac{1}{2})</m> and
      <m>(\frac{1}{2},-1)</m> highlighting the reflection of the curves across <m>y = x</m>.

      To close our review of important facts about inverses,
      we recall that the natural exponential function
      <m>y = f(x) = e^x</m> has an inverse function,
      namely the natural logarithm,
      <m>x = f^{-1}(y) = \ln(y)</m>.
      Thus, writing <m>y = e^x</m> is interchangeable with <m>x = \ln(y)</m>,
      plus <m>\ln(e^x) = x</m> for every real number <m>x</m> and
      <m>e^{\ln(y)} = y</m> for every positive real number <m>y</m>.

  <subsection permid="uZD">
    <title>The derivative of the natural logarithm function</title>
    <p permid="CiD">
      In what follows,
      we find a formula for the derivative of <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m>.
      To do so, we take advantage of the fact that we know the derivative of the natural exponential function,
      the inverse of <m>g</m>.
      In particular, we know that writing
      <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m> is equivalent to writing <m>e^{g(x)} = x</m>.
      Now we differentiate both sides of this equation and observe that

      This rule for the natural logarithm function now joins our list of basic derivative rules.

    </p>

    <p permid="mZF">
      Also notice that for the first time in our work,
      differentiating a basic function of a particular type has led to a function of a very different nature:
      the derivative of the natural logarithm is not another logarithm,
      nor even an exponential function,
      but rather a rational one.
    </p>

    <p permid="TgO">
      Derivatives of logarithms may now be computed in concert with all of the rules known to date.
      For instance, if <m>f(t) = \ln(t^2 + 1)</m>,
      then by the chain rule, <m>f'(t) = \frac{1}{t^2 + 1} \cdot 2t</m>.

        In <xref ref="F-2-6-Log-Exp">Figure</xref>,
        we are reminded that since the natural exponential function has the property that its derivative is itself,
        the slope of the tangent to <m>y = e^x</m> is equal to the height of the curve at that point.
        For instance, at the point <m>A = (\ln(0.5), 0.5)</m>,
        the slope of the tangent line is <m>m_A = 0.5</m>,
        and at <m>B = (\ln(5), 5)</m>,
        the tangent line's slope is <m>m_B = 5</m>.

      At the corresponding points <m>A'</m> and <m>B'</m> on the graph of the natural logarithm function
      (which come from reflecting <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> across the line <m>y = x</m>),
      we know that the slope of the tangent line is the reciprocal of the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the point (since <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}</m>).
      Thus, at <m>A' = (0.5, \ln(0.5))</m>,
      we have <m>m_{A'} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2</m>,
      and at <m>B' = (5, \ln(5))</m>,
      <m>m_{B'} = \frac{1}{5}</m>.

    <p permid="LCp">
      In particular, we observe that
      <m>m_{A'} = \frac{1}{m_A}</m> and <m>m_{B'} = \frac{1}{m_B}</m>.
      This is not a coincidence,
      but in fact holds for any curve <m>y = f(x)</m> and its inverse,
      provided the inverse exists.
      This is due to the reflection across <m>y = x</m>.
      It changes the roles of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
      thus reversing the rise and run,
      so the slope of the inverse function at the reflected point is the reciprocal of the slope of the original function.

    <title>Inverse trigonometric functions and their derivatives</title>
    <p permid="rJy">
      Trigonometric functions are periodic,
      so they fail to be one-to-one,

      However, we can restrict the domain of each trigonometric function
      so that it is one-to-one on that domain.

      For instance,

      the function is one-to-one and thus has an inverse.
      Thus, the function <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> with

    <title>The link between the derivative of a function and the derivative of its inverse</title>
    <p permid="Bdk">
      In <xref ref="F-2-6-Log-Exp">Figure</xref>,
      we saw an interesting relationship between the slopes of tangent lines to the natural exponential and natural logarithm functions at points reflected across the line <m>y = x</m>.
      In particular, we observed that at the point 
      <m>(\ln(2), 2)</m> on the graph of <m>f(x) = e^x</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line is <m>f'(\ln(2)) = 2</m>,
      while at the corresponding point
      <m>(2, \ln(2))</m> on the graph of <m>f^{-1}(x) = \ln(x)</m>,
      the slope of the tangent line is <m>(f^{-1})'(2) = \frac{1}{2}</m>,
      which is the reciprocal of <m>f'(\ln(2))</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="hkt">
      That the two corresponding tangent lines have reciprocal slopes is not a coincidence.
      If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable inverse functions, then
      <m>y = f(x)</m> if and only if <m>x = g(y)</m>,
      then<m>f(g(x)) = x</m> for every <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      Differentiating both sides of this equation, we have
      <me permid="gfa">
        \frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = \frac{d}{dx} [x]
      </me>,
      and by the chain rule,
      <me permid="Mmj">
        f'(g(x)) g'(x) = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="NrC">
      Solving for <m>g'(x)</m>, we have <m>g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}</m>.
      Here we see that the slope of the tangent line to the inverse function <m>g</m> at the point
      <m>(x,g(x))</m> is precisely the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to the original function <m>f</m> at the point <m>(g(x),f(g(x))) = (g(x),x)</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-6-Gen-Inv" permid="Sbv">
      <caption>A graph of function <m>y = f(x)</m> along with its inverse, <m>y = g(x) = f^{-1}(x)</m>.  Observe that the slopes of the two tangent lines are reciprocals of one another.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/2_6_GenInv" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="tyL">
      To see this more clearly,
      consider the graph of the function
      <m>y = f(x)</m> shown in <xref ref="F-2-6-Gen-Inv">Figure</xref>,
      along with its inverse <m>y = g(x)</m>.
      Given a point <m>(a,b)</m> that lies on the graph of <m>f</m>,
      we know that <m>(b,a)</m> lies on the graph of <m>g</m>;
      because <m>f(a) = b</m> and <m>g(b) = a</m>.
      Now, applying the rule that
      <m>g'(x) = 1/f'(g(x))</m> to the value <m>x = b</m>, we have
      <me permid="sts">
        g'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(g(b))} = \frac{1}{f'(a)}
      </me>,
      which is precisely what we see in the figure:
      the slope of the tangent line to <m>g</m> at <m>(b,a)</m> is the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>(a,b)</m>,
      since these two lines are reflections of one another across the line <m>y = x</m>.

      <title>Derivative of an inverse function</title>
      <p permid="ZFU">
            <idx><h>derivative</h><h>inverse</h></idx>
        Suppose that <m>f</m> is a differentiable function with inverse <m>g</m> and that <m>(a,b)</m> is a point that lies on the graph of <m>f</m> at which <m>f'(a) \ne 0</m>.
        Then
        <me permid="YAB">
          g'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(a)}
        </me>.

    </assemblage>

    <p permid="FNd">
      More generally, for any <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>g'</m>,
      we have <m>g'(x) = 1/f'(g(x))</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="lUm">
      The rules we derived for <m>\ln(x)</m>, <m>\arcsin(x)</m>,
      and <m>\arctan(x)</m> are all just specific examples of this general property of the derivative of an inverse function.
      For example,
      with <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m> and <m>f(x) = e^x</m>, it follows that
      <me permid="EHK">
        g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))} = \frac{1}{e^{\ln(x)}} = \frac{1}{x}
      </me>.
