    Suppose that a person is taking a walk along a long straight path and walks at a constant rate of 3 miles per hour.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          On the left-hand axes provided in <xref ref="F-4-1-PA1">Figure</xref>,
          sketch a labeled graph of the velocity function
          <m>v(t) = 3</m>. <figure xml:id="F-4-1-PA1"> <caption>At left,
          axes for plotting <m>y = v(t)</m>;
          at right, for plotting
    <m>y = s(t)</m>.</caption> <image width="100%" source="images/4_1_PA1" /> </figure> Note that while the scale on the two sets of axes is the same,
          the units on the right-hand axes differ from those on the left.
          The right-hand axes will be used in question (d).

      <li>
        <p>
          How far did the person travel during the two hours?
          How is this distance related to the area of a certain region under the graph of <m>y = v(t)</m>?

      <li>
        <p>
          Find an algebraic formula, <m>s(t)</m>,
          for the position of the person at time <m>t</m>,
          assuming that <m>s(0) = 0</m>.
          Explain your thinking.

          For what values of <m>t</m> is the position function <m>s</m> increasing?
