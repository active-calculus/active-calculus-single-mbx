    Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity,
    a differential equation naturally arises.
    In the following two problems,
    we see two such scenarios;
    for each, we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose you have a bank account in which money grows at an
                    annual rate of 3<percent />.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <title>(i)</title>
              <p>
                If you have <dollar />10,000 in the account,
                at what rate is your money growing?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <title>(ii)</title>
              <p>
                Suppose that you are also withdrawing money from the account at <dollar />1,000 per year.
                What is the rate of change in the amount of money in the account?
                What are the units on this rate of change?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose that a water tank holds 100 gallons and that a salty
                    solution,
          which contains 20 grams of salt in every gallon,
    enters the
                    tank at 2 gallons per minute.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <title>(i)</title>
              <p>
                How much salt enters the tank each minute?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <title>(ii)</title>
              <p>
                Suppose that initially there are 300 grams of salt in the tank.
                How much salt is in each gallon at this point in time?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <title>(iii)</title>
              <p>
                Finally,
          suppose that evenly mixed solution is pumped out of the tank at the rate of 2 gallons per minute.
                How much salt leaves the tank each minute?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <title>(iv)</title>
              <p>
                What is the total rate of change in the amount of salt in the tank?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
