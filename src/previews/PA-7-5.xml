    Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity,
    a differential equation naturally arises.
    In the following two problems,
    we see two such scenarios;
    for each, we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest.

                What is the rate of change in the amount of money in the account?
                What are the units on this rate of change?

          tank at 2 gallons per minute.
