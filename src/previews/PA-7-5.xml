    Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity,
    a differential equation naturally arises.
    In the following two problems,
    we see two such scenarios;
    for each, we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest.
    <ol label="a.">
    <li>
      <p>
        Suppose you have a bank account in which money grows at an
        annual rate of 3<percent />.
        <ol label="i.">
          <li>
            <p>
              If you have <dollar />10,000 in the account,
              at what rate is your money growing?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose that you are also withdrawing money from the account at <dollar />1,000 per year.
              What is the rate of change in the amount of money in the account?
              What are the units on this rate of change?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Suppose that a water tank holds 100 gallons and that a salty
        solution,
        which contains 20 grams of salt in every gallon,
        enters the
        tank at 2 gallons per minute.
        <ol label="i.">
          <li>
            <p>
              How much salt enters the tank each minute?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose that initially there are 300 grams of salt in the tank.
              How much salt is in each gallon at this point in time?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Finally,
        suppose that evenly mixed solution is pumped out of the tank at the rate of 2 gallons per minute.
              How much salt leaves the tank each minute?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              What is the total rate of change in the amount of salt in the tank?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    </ol>
