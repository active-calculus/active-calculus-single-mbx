            Suppose that the height <m>s</m> of a ball (in feet) at time <m>t</m> (in seconds) is given by the formula <m>s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2</m>.
            <ol label="a.">
                <li><p>Construct an accurate graph of <m>y = s(t)</m> on the time interval <m>0 \le t \le 3</m>.  Label at least six distinct points on the graph, including the three points that correspond to when the ball was released, when the ball reaches its highest point, and when the ball lands.</p></li>
                <li><p>In everyday language, describe the behavior of the ball on the time interval <m>0 \lt  t \lt  1</m> and on time interval <m>1 \lt  t \lt  3</m>.  What occurs at the instant <m>t = 1</m>?</p></li>
                <li><p>Consider the expression

                Compute the value of <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m>.  What does this value measure geometrically?  What does this value measure physically?  In particular, what are the units on <m>AV_{[0.5,1]}</m>?</p></li>
