Functions of the form <m>f(x) = x^n</m>, where <m>n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots</m>, are often called <term>power functions</term>. The first two questions below revisit work we did earlier in <xref ref="C-1">Chapter</xref>, and the following questions extend those ideas to higher powers of <m>x</m>.
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to find <m>f'(x)</m> for <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to find <m>f'(x)</m> for <m>f(x) = x^3</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to find <m>f'(x)</m> for <m>f(x) = x^4</m>.  (Hint: <m>(a+b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4</m>.  Apply this rule to <m>(x+h)^4</m> within the limit definition.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Based on your work in (a), (b), and (c), what do you conjecture is the derivative of <m>f(x) = x^5</m>?  Of <m>f(x) = x^{13}</m>?</p></li>
        <li><p>Conjecture a formula for the derivative of <m>f(x) = x^n</m> that holds for any positive integer <m>n</m>.  That is, given <m>f(x) = x^n</m> where <m>n</m> is a positive integer, what do you think is the formula for <m>f'(x)</m>?</p></li>
