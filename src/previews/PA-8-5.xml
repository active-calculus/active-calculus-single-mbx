      showed how we can approximate the number <m>e</m> using linear,
      quadratic,
      and other polynomial functions;
      we then used similar ideas in <xref ref="PA-8-4">Preview Activity</xref> to approximate <m>\ln(2)</m>.
      In this activity,
      we review and extend the process to find the <q>best</q>
      quadratic approximation to the exponential function <m>e^x</m> around the origin.
      Let <m>f(x) = e^x</m> throughout this activity.

            Find a formula for <m>P_1(x)</m>,
            the linearization of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m>.
            (We label this linearization <m>P_1</m> because it is a first degree polynomial approximation.)
            Recall that <m>P_1(x)</m> is a good approximation to <m>f(x)</m> for values of <m>x</m> close to <m>0</m>.
            Plot <m>f</m> and <m>P_1</m> near <m>x=0</m> to illustrate this fact.

            Since <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is not linear,
            the linear approximation eventually is not a very good one.
            To obtain better approximations,
            we want to develop a different approximation that <q>bends</q>
            to make it more closely fit the graph of <m>f</m> near <m>x=0</m>.
            To do so, we  add a quadratic term to <m>P_1(x)</m>.
            In other words, we let
            <me permid="idR">
              P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2x^2
            </me>
            for some real number <m>c_2</m>.
            We need to determine the value  of <m>c_2</m> that makes the graph of <m>P_2(x)</m> best fit the graph of <m>f(x)</m> near <m>x=0</m>.

          <p permid="Ahv">
            Remember that <m>P_1(x)</m> was a good linear approximation to <m>f(x)</m> near <m>0</m>;
            this is because <m>P_1(0) = f(0)</m> and <m>P'_1(0) = f'(0)</m>.
            It is therefore reasonable to seek a value of <m>c_2</m> so that

                  The second derivative of a function tells us the concavity of the function.
                  Concavity measures how the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of the function are changing.
                  This tells us how much bend there is in the graph.
                  So if <m>P''_2(0) = f''(0)</m>,
                  then <m>P_2</m> will have the same bend in it at <m>x=0</m> as <m>f</m> does.
                  This will make the graph of <m>P_2</m> mold to the graph of <m>f</m> around <m>x=0</m>.
