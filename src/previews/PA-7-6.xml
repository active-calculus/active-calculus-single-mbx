    Recall that one model for population growth states that a population grows at a rate proportional to its size.

          We begin with the differential equation

          Let's now consider a modified differential equation given by

            \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac 12 P(3-P)
          </me>.
          As before,
    sketch a slope field as well as a few typical solutions on the following axes provided.
