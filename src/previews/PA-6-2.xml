      <p>Consider a circular cone of radius 3 and height 5, which we view horizontally as pictured in <xref ref="F-PA-6-2">Figure</xref>. Our goal in this activity is to use a definite integral to determine the volume of the cone.

      <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Find a formula for the linear function <m>y = f(x)</m> that is pictured in <xref ref="F-PA-6-2">Figure</xref>.</p></li>

        <li><p>For the representative slice of thickness <m>\triangle x</m> that is located horizontally at a location <m>x</m> (somewhere between <m>x = 0</m> and <m>x = 5</m>), what is the radius of the representative slice?  Note that the radius depends on the value of <m>x</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>What is the volume of the representative slice you found in (b)?</p></li>

        <li><p>What definite integral will sum the volumes of the thin slices across the full horizontal span of the cone?  What is the exact value of this definite integral?</p></li>

        <li><p>Compare the result of your work in (d) to the volume of the cone that comes from using the formula <m>V_{\text{cone} } = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h.</m></p></li>
