    Consider the function <m>g(x) = 2^x</m>,
    which is graphed in <xref ref="F-2-2-PA1">Figure</xref>.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          At each of <m>x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2</m>,
          use a straightedge to sketch an accurate tangent line to <m>y = g(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Use the provided grid to estimate the slope of the tangent line you drew at each point in (a).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Use the limit definition of the derivative to estimate <m>g'(0)</m> by using small values of <m>h</m>,
          and compare the result to your visual estimate for the slope of the tangent line to
          <m>y = g(x)</m> at <m>x = 0</m> in (b).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Based on your work in (a), (b), and (c),
          sketch an accurate graph of
          <m>y = g'(x)</m> on the axes adjacent to the graph of <m>y = g(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Write at least one sentence that explains why it is reasonable to think that <m>g'(x) = cg(x)</m>,
          where <m>c</m> is a constant.
          In addition, calculate <m>\ln(2)</m>,
          and then discuss how this value,
          combined with your work above,
          reasonably suggests that <m>g'(x) = 2^x \ln(2)</m>.
