      Suppose that <m>g</m> is the function given by the graph below.
      Use the graph to answer each of the following questions.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%" valign="bottom">

              Determine the values <m>g(-2)</m>, <m>g(-1)</m>,
              <m>g(0)</m>, <m>g(1)</m>,
        and <m>g(2)</m>, if defined.
              If the function value is not defined,
              explain what feature of the graph tells you this.

          <li>
            <p>
              For each of the values <m>a = -1</m>,
              <m>a = 0</m>, and <m>a = 2</m>,
              complete the following sentence:
              <q>As <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
              (but not equal)
              to <m>a</m>,
              <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to <fillin />.</q>

              What happens as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer
              (but not equal)
              to <m>a = 1</m>?
              Does the function <m>g(x)</m> get as close as we would like to a single value?
