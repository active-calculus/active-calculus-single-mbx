      In <xref ref="C-7">Chapter</xref>,
      we learned some of the many important applications of differential equations,
      and learned some approaches to solve or analyze them.
      Here, we consider an important approach that will allow us to solve a wider variety of differential equations.
    </p>

    <p permid="wRq">
      Let's consider the familiar differential equation from exponential population growth given by
      <men xml:id="eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode" permid="pmR">
        y' = ky
      </men>,
      where <m>k</m> is the constant of proportionality.
      While we can solve this differential equation using methods we have already learned,
      we take a different approach now that can be applied to a much larger set of differential equations.
      For the rest of this activity,
      let's assume that <m>k=1</m>.
      We will use our knowledge of Taylor series to find a solution to the differential equation <xref ref="eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode" />.
    </p>

    <p permid="cYz">
      To do so, we assume that we have a solution <m>y=f(x)</m> and that <m>f(x)</m> has a Taylor series that can be written in the form
      <me permid="Vua">
        y = f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^k
      </me>,
      where the coefficients <m>a_k</m> are undetermined.
      Our task is to find the coefficients.
