    Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be the functions defined by

          Let <m>p(t) = 2t^2 (t^3 + 4t)</m> and observe that <m>p(t) = f(t) \cdot g(t)</m>.
          Rewrite the formula for <m>p</m> by distributing the <m>2t^2</m> term.
          Then,

          Rewrite the formula for <m>q</m> by dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator and simplify to write <m>q</m> as a sum of constant multiples of powers of <m>t</m>.
