      <p>Suppose that the following information is known about a function <m>f</m>: the graph of its derivative, <m>y = f'(x)</m>, is given in <xref ref="F-5-1-PA1">Figure</xref>. Further, assume that <m>f'</m> is piecewise linear (as pictured) and that for <m>x \le 0</m> and <m>x \ge 6</m>, <m>f'(x) = 0</m>. Finally, it is given that <m>f(0) = 1</m>.</p>

      <figure xml:id="F-5-1-PA1" >
        <caption>At left, the graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>; at right, axes for plotting <m>y = f(x)</m>.</caption>

      <p><ol label="a.">
        <li><p>On what interval(s) is <m>f</m> an increasing function?  On what intervals is <m>f</m> decreasing?</p></li>

        <li><p>On what interval(s) is <m>f</m> concave up?  concave down?</p></li>

        <li><p>At what point(s) does <m>f</m> have a relative minimum?  a relative maximum?</p></li>

        <li><p>Recall that the Total Change Theorem tells us that

              f(1) - f(0) = \int_0^1 f'(x) \, dx.
            </me>
            What is the exact value of <m>f(1)</m>?</p></li>

        <li><p>Use the given information and similar reasoning to that in (d) to determine the exact value of <m>f(2)</m>, <m>f(3)</m>, <m>f(4)</m>, <m>f(5)</m>, and <m>f(6)</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Based on your responses to all of the preceding questions, sketch a complete and accurate graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> on the axes provided, being sure to indicate the behavior of <m>f</m> for <m>x \lt  0</m> and <m>x \gt 6</m>.</p></li>
