    In <xref ref="sec-2-5-chain">Section</xref>,
    we learned the Chain Rule and how it can be applied to find the derivative of a composite function.
    In particular,
    if <m>u</m> is a differentiable function of <m>x</m>,
    and <m>f</m> is a differentiable function of <m>u(x)</m>, then
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(u(x))  \right] = f'(u(x)) \cdot u'(x)
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In words, we say that the derivative of a composite function <m>c(x) = f(u(x))</m>,
    where <m>f</m> is considered the <q>outer</q>
    function and <m>u</m> the <q>inner</q> function,
    is <q>the derivative of the outer function,
    evaluated at the inner function,
    times the derivative of the inner function.</q>

        For each of the following functions,
        use the Chain Rule to find the function's derivative.
        Be sure to label each derivative by name (e.g., the derivative of <m>g(x)</m> should be labeled <m>g'(x)</m>).
