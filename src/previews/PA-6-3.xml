      <p>In each of the following scenarios, we consider the distribution of a quantity along an axis.

      <ol label="a.">
        <li><p>Suppose that the function <m>c(x) = 200 + 100 e^{-0.1x}</m> models the density of traffic on a straight road, measured in cars per mile, where <m>x</m> is number of miles east of a major interchange, and consider the definite integral <m>\int_0^2 (200 + 100 e^{-0.1x}) \, dx</m>.

        <ol label="i.">
          <li>
            <p>What are the units on the product <m>c(x) \cdot \triangle x</m>?</p></li>

          <li>
            <p>What are the units on the definite integral and its Riemann sum approximation given by
              <me>
                \int_0^2 c(x) \, dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n c(x_i) \triangle x?
              </me>
            </p></li>

          <li>
            <p>Evaluate the definite integral <m>\int_0^2 c(x) \, dx = \int_0^2 \left(200 + 100 e^{-0.1x}\right) \, dx</m> and write one sentence to explain the meaning of the value you find.</p></li>
        </ol>
        </p></li>

        <li><p>On a 6 foot long shelf filled with books, the function <m>B</m> models the distribution of the weight of the books, in pounds per inch, where <m>x</m> is the number of inches from the left end of the bookshelf.  Let <m>B(x)</m> be given by the rule <m>B(x) = 0.5 + \frac{1}{(x+1)^2}</m>.
