    The position of a moving object is given by the
    function <m>s(t)</m>,
    where <m>s</m> is measured in feet and <m>t</m> in seconds.
    We
    determine that the velocity is <m>v(t) = 4t + 1</m> feet per second.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          How much does the position change over the time interval <m>[0,4]</m>?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Does this give you enough information to determine <m>s(4)</m>,
          the position at time <m>t=4</m>?
          If so, what is <m>s(4)</m>?
          If not,
    what additional information would you need to know to determine <m>s(4)</m>?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose you are told that the object's initial position <m>s(0) = 7</m>.
          Determine <m>s(2)</m>,
    the object's position 2 seconds later.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If you are told instead that the object's initial position is
          <m>s(0) = 3</m>, what is <m>s(2)</m>?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If we only know the velocity <m>v(t)=4t+1</m>,
          is it possible that the object's position at all times is <m>s(t) = 2t^2 + t - 4</m>?
          Explain how you know.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Are there other possibilities for <m>s(t)</m>?
          If so, what are they?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If, in addition to knowing the velocity function is <m>v(t) = 4t+1</m>,
          we know the initial position <m>s(0)</m>,
          how many possibilities are there for <m>s(t)</m>?
