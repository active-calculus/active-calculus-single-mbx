The position of a car driving along a straight road at time <m>t</m> in minutes is given by the function <m>y = s(t)</m> that is pictured in <xref ref="F-1-6-PA1">Figure</xref>. The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet. For instance, the point <m>(2,4)</m> on the graph indicates that after 2 minutes, the car has traveled 4000 feet.

        <li><p>In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time interval.  In particular, you should carefully discuss what is happening on each of the time intervals <m>[0,1]</m>, <m>[1,2]</m>, <m>[2,3]</m>, <m>[3,4]</m>, and <m>[4,5]</m>, plus provide commentary overall on what the car is doing on the interval <m>[0,12]</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>On the lefthand axes provided in <xref ref="F-1-6-PA1b">Figure</xref>, sketch a careful, accurate graph of <m>y = s'(t)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>What is the meaning of the function <m>y = s'(t)</m> in the context of the given problem?  What can we say about the car's behavior when <m>s'(t)</m> is positive?  when <m>s'(t)</m> is zero?  when <m>s'(t)</m> is negative?</p></li>
        <li><p>Rename the function you graphed in (b) to be called <m>y = v(t)</m>.  Describe the behavior of <m>v</m> in words, using phrases like <q><m>v</m> is increasing on the interval <m>\ldots</m></q> and <q><m>v</m> is constant on the interval <m>\ldots</m>.</q></p></li>
        <li><p>Sketch a graph of the function <m>y = v'(t)</m> on the righthand axes provide in <xref ref="F-1-6-PA1b">Figure</xref>.  Write at least one sentence to explain how the behavior of <m>v'(t)</m> is connected to the graph of <m>y=v(t)</m>.</p></li>
