    The position of a car driving along a straight road at time <m>t</m> in minutes is given by the function
    <m>y = s(t)</m> that is pictured in <xref ref="F-1-6-PA1">Figure</xref>.
    The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet.
    For instance,
    the point <m>(2,4)</m> on the graph indicates that after 2 minutes,
    the car has traveled 4000 feet.
