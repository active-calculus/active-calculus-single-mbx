    According to U.S.<nbsp />postal regulations,
    the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches,
    where by <q>girth</q> we mean the perimeter of the smallest end.
    What is the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail?
    What are the dimensions of the package of largest volume?

          The problem statement tells us that the parcel's girth plus length may not exceed 108 inches.
          In order to maximize volume,
          we assume that we will actually need the girth plus length to equal 108 inches.
