Let <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m> be arbitrary real numbers with <m>a \ne 0</m>, and let <m>f</m> be the function given by the rule <m>f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k</m>.
    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>What familiar type of function is <m>f</m>?  What information do you know about <m>f</m> just by looking at its form? (Think about the roles of <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m>.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Next we use some calculus to develop familiar ideas from a different perspective.  To start, treat <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m> as constants and compute <m>f'(x)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Find all critical numbers of <m>f</m>. (These will depend on at least one of <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m>.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Assume that <m>a \lt  0</m>.  Construct a first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Based on the information you've found above, classify the critical values of <m>f</m> as maxima or minima.</p></li>
