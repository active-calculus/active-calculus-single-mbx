    Let <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>,
    and <m>k</m> be arbitrary real numbers with <m>a \ne 0</m>,
    and let <m>f</m> be the function given by the rule <m>f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k</m>.
    <ol label="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          What familiar type of function is <m>f</m>?
          What information do you know about <m>f</m> just by looking at its form? (Think about the roles of <m>a</m>,
    <m>h</m>,
          and <m>k</m>.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Next we use some calculus to develop familiar ideas from a different perspective.
          To start, treat <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>,
          and <m>k</m> as constants and compute <m>f'(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Find all critical numbers of <m>f</m>. (These will depend on at least one of <m>a</m>,
    <m>h</m>,
          and <m>k</m>.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Assume that <m>a \lt 0</m>.
          Construct a first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Based on the information you've found above,
          classify the critical values of <m>f</m> as maxima or minima.
        </p>
