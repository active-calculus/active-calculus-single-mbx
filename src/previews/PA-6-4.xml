    A bucket is being lifted from the bottom of a 50-foot deep well;
    its weight
    (including the water),
    <m>B</m>, in pounds at a height <m>h</m> feet above the water is given by the function <m>B(h)</m>.
    When the bucket leaves the water,
    the bucket and water together weigh <m>B(0) = 20</m> pounds,
    and when the bucket reaches the top of the well, <m>B(50) = 12</m> pounds.
    Assume that the bucket loses water at a constant rate
    (as a function of height, <m>h</m>)
    throughout its journey from the bottom to the top of the well.
