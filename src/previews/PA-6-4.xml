      <p>A bucket is being lifted from the bottom of a 50-foot deep well; its weight (including the water), <m>B</m>, in pounds at a height <m>h</m> feet above the water is given by the function <m>B(h)</m>. When the bucket leaves the water, the bucket and water together weigh <m>B(0) = 20</m> pounds, and when the bucket reaches the top of the well, <m>B(50) = 12</m> pounds. Assume that the bucket loses water at a constant rate (as a function of height, <m>h</m>) throughout its journey from the bottom to the top of the well.

      <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Find a formula for <m>B(h)</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Compute the value of the product <m>B(5) \triangle h</m>, where <m>\triangle h = 2</m> feet. Include units on your answer.  Explain why this product represents the approximate work it took to move the bucket of water from <m>h = 5</m> to <m>h = 7</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Is the value in (b) an over- or under-estimate of the actual amount of work it took to move the bucket from <m>h = 5</m> to <m>h = 7</m>?  Why?</p></li>

        <li><p>Compute the value of the product <m>B(22) \triangle h</m>, where <m>\triangle h = 0.25</m> feet.  Include units on your answer.  What is the meaning of the value you found?</p></li>

        <li><p>More generally, what does the quantity <m>W_{\mbox{slice} } = B(h) \triangle h</m> measure for a given value of <m>h</m> and a small positive value of <m>\triangle h</m>?</p></li>

        <li><p>Evaluate the definite integral <m>\int_0^{50} B(h) \, dh</m>.  What is the meaning of the value you find?  Why?</p></li>
