      Studying the units on the integrand and variable of integration helps us understand the meaning of a definite integral.
      For instance,
      if <m>v(t)</m> is the velocity of an object moving along an axis,
      measured in feet per second,
      and <m>t</m> measures time in seconds,
      then both the definite integral and its Riemann sum approximation,
      <me permid="lzN">
        \int_a^b v(t) \, dt \approx \sum_{i=1}^n v(t_i) \Delta t

      <me permid="RGW">
        \text{(feet/sec)} \cdot \text{(sec)} = \text{feet}
      </me>.
      Thus, <m>\int_a^b v(t) \, dt</m> measures the total change in position  
      of the moving object in feet.

      Unit analysis will be particularly helpful to us in what follows.

    <title>Density</title>

    <p permid="VGV">
      The <em>mass</em>
          <idx><h>mass</h></idx>
      of a quantity,
      typically measured in metric units such as grams or kilograms,
      is a measure of the amount of the quantity.
      In a corresponding way,
      the <em>density</em> of an object measures the distribution of mass per unit volume.
      For instance,
      if a brick has mass 3 kg and volume 0.002 m<m>^3</m>,
      then the density of the brick is
      <me permid="xOf">
        \frac{3 \mbox{kg} }{0.002 \mbox{m} ^3} = 1500 \frac{\mbox{kg} }{\mbox{m} ^3}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="BOe">
      As another example, the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m<m>^3</m>.
      Each of these relationships demonstrate the following general principle.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="eqN">
      <p permid="hVn">
        For an object of constant density <m>d</m>,
        with mass <m>m</m> and volume <m>V</m>,
        <me permid="dVo">
          d = \frac{m}{V}, \ \text{or}  \ m = d \cdot V
        </me>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="Ocw">
      But what happens when the density is not constant?
    </p>

    <p permid="ujF">
      The formula <m>m = d \cdot V</m> is reminiscent of two other equations that we have used 
      in our work: for a body moving in a fixed direction,
      distance = rate <m>\cdot</m> time, and,
      for a rectangle, its area is given by <m>A = l \cdot w</m>.
      These formulas hold when the principal quantities involved,
      such as the rate the body moves and the height of the rectangle,
      are <em>constant</em>.
      When these quantities are not constant,
      we have turned to the definite integral for assistance.
      By working with small slices on which the quantity of interest
      (such as velocity)
      is approximately constant,
      we can use a definite integral to add up the values on the pieces.
    </p>

    <p permid="aqO">
      For example,
      if we have a nonnegative velocity function that is not constant,
      over a short time interval
      <m>\Delta t</m> we know that the distance traveled is approximately <m>v(t) \Delta t</m>,
      since <m>v(t)</m> is almost constant on a small interval.
      Similarly, if we are thinking about the area under a nonnegative function <m>f</m> whose value is changing,
      on a short interval <m>\Delta x</m> the area under the curve is approximately the area of the rectangle whose height is <m>f(x)</m> and whose width is
      <m>\Delta x</m>: <m>f(x) \Delta x</m>.
      Both of these principles are represented visually in <xref ref="F-6-3-VelArea">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-6-3-VelArea" permid="roZ">
      <caption>At left, estimating a small amount of distance traveled, <m>v(t) \Delta t</m>, and at right, a small amount of area under the curve, <m>f(x) \Delta x</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/6_3_VelArea" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="GxX">
      In a similar way,
      if the density of some object is not constant, we can use a
      definite integral to compute the overall mass of the object.
      We will focus on problems where the density varies in only one dimension,
      say along a single axis.
    </p>

    <p permid="mFg">
      Let's consider a thin bar of length <m>b</m> whose left end is at the origin,
      where <m>x = 0</m>,
      and assume that the bar has constant cross-sectional area of 1 cm<m>^2</m>.
      We let <m>\rho(x)</m> represent the mass density function of the bar,
      measured in grams per cubic centimeter.
      That is, given a location <m>x</m>,
      <m>\rho(x)</m> tells us approximately how much mass will be found in a one-centimeter wide slice of the bar at <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-6-3-Bar" permid="Xwi">
      <caption>A thin bar of constant cross-sectional area 1 cm<m>^2</m> with density function <m>\rho(x)</m> g/cm<m>^3</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/6_3_Bar" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="SMp">
      The volume of a thin slice of the bar of width <m>\Delta x</m>,
      as pictured in <xref ref="F-6-3-Bar">Figure</xref>,
      is the cross-sectional area times <m>\Delta x</m>.
      Since the cross-sections each have constant area 1 cm<m>^2</m>,
      it follows that the volume of the slice is <m>1 \Delta x</m> cm<m>^3</m>.
      And because mass is the product of density and volume,
      we see that the mass of this slice is approximately
      <me permid="Kcx">
        \text{mass} _{\text{slice} } \approx \rho(x) \ \frac{\mbox{g} }{\mbox{cm} ^3} \cdot 1 \Delta x \ \mbox{cm} ^3 = \rho(x) \cdot \Delta x \ \mbox{g}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="yTy">
      The corresponding Riemann sum (and the integral that it approximates),
      <me permid="qjG">
        \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(x_i) \Delta x \approx \int_0^b \rho(x) \, dx
      </me>,
      therefore measure the mass of the bar between <m>0</m> and <m>b</m>.
      (The Riemann sum is an approximation,
      while the integral will be the exact mass.)
    </p>

    <p permid="faH">
      For objects whose cross-sectional area is constant and whose mass is distributed relative to horizontal 
      location, <m>x</m>,
      it makes sense to think of the density function <m>\rho(x)</m> with units
      <q>mass per unit length,</q> such as g/cm.
      Thus, when we compute <m>\rho(x) \cdot \Delta x</m> on a small slice <m>\Delta x</m>,
      the resulting units are g/cm <m>\cdot</m> cm = g, which thus measures the mass of the slice.
      The general principle follows.

    <title>Weighted Averages</title>
    <p permid="DDr">
      The concept of an average is a natural one,
      and one that we have used repeatedly as part of our understanding of the meaning of the definite integral.
      If we have <m>n</m> values <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>,

      As we continue to think about problems involving the distribution of mass,

      If all of the classes were of the same weight (i.e., the same number of credits),

      The weighted average reflects the fact that chemistry and calculus,
