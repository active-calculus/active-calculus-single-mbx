    <p permid="JFY">
      Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative,
      and the definition of the derivative involves a limit,
      there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits.
      In addition,
      the limit involved in the definition of the derivative always generates the indeterminate form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      If <m>f</m> is a differentiable function,
      thenin the definition
      <me permid="CLt">
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>,
      not only does <m>h \to 0</m> in the denominator,
      but also <m>(f(x+h)-f(x)) \to 0</m> in the numerator,
      since <m>f</m> is continuous.
      Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do:
      indeed, limits of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> can take on any value,
      as is evidenced by evaluating <m>f'(x)</m> for varying values of <m>x</m> for a function such as <m>f'(x) = x^2</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pNh">
      We have learned many techniques for evaluating the limits that result from the derivative definition,
      including a large number of shortcut rules.
      In this section, we turn the situation upside-down:
      instead of using limits to evaluate derivatives,
      we explore how to use derivatives to evaluate certain limits.

    <p permid="VUq">
      The idea demonstrated in <xref ref="PA-2-8">Preview Activity</xref>
      <mdash /> that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest <mdash /> can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits.
      We with a function <m>h(x)</m> that can be written as a quotient
      <m>h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>,
      where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both differentiable at <m>x=a</m> and for which <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>.
      We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} h(x)</m>.
      <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR">Figure</xref> illustrates the situation.
      We see that both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x = a</m>.
      Their respective tangent line approximations <m>L_f</m> and <m>L_g</m> at <m>x = a</m>
      are also shown in the figure.
      We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as <m>x \to a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Cbz">
      First, let's recall that <m>L_f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)</m> and <m>L_g(x) = g'(a)(x-a) +g(a)</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is getting arbitrarily close to <m>a</m> when we take the limit,
      we can replace <m>f</m> with <m>L_f</m> and replace <m>g</m> with <m>L_g</m>,
      and thus we observe that
      <md permid="iSC">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)}{g'(a)(x-a) + g(a)}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iiI">
      Next, we remember that both <m>f(a) = 0</m> and <m>g(a) = 0</m>,
      which is precisely what makes the original limit indeterminate.
      Substituting these values for <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m> in the limit above,
      we now have
      <md permid="vgU">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{g'(a)(x-a)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</mrow>
      </md>,
      where the latter equality holds because
      <m>\frac{x-a}{x-a} = 1</m> when <m>x</m> is approaching
      (but not equal to) <m>a</m>.
      Finally, we note that <m>\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m> is constant with respect to <m>x</m>, and thus
      <me permid="OZL">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OpR">
      This result holds as long as <m>g'(a)</m> is not equal to zero.
      The formal name of the result is L'Hôpital's Rule.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="KLr">
      <title>L'Hôpital's Rule</title>
      <idx><h>L'Hôpital's rule</h></idx>

      <p permid="uxa">
        Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable at <m>x=a</m>,
        and suppose that <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m> and that <m>g'(a) \neq 0</m>.
        Then <m>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="aEj">
      In practice,
      we typically work with a slightly more general version of L'Hôpital's Rule,
      which states that (under the identical assumptions as the boxed rule above and the extra assumption that <m>g'</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>)
      <me permid="bod">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
      </me>,
      provided the righthand limit exists.
      This form reflects the basic idea of L'Hôpital's Rule:
      if <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> produces an indeterminate limit of form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> as <m>x \to a</m>,
      that limit is equivalent to the limit of the quotient of the two functions' derivatives,
      <m>\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="GLs">
      For example,
      if we consider the limit from <xref ref="PA-2-8">Preview Activity</xref>,
      <me permid="Hvm">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1}
      </me>,
      by L'Hôpital's Rule we have that
      <me permid="nCv">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{5x^4 + 1}{2x} = \frac{6}{2} = 3. \\
      </me>
    </p>

    <p permid="mSB">
      By replacing the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives,
      we often replace an indeterminate limit with one whose value we can easily determine.
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-2-8-1.xml" />

    <p permid="SZK">
      While L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied in an entirely algebraic way,
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-8-LHR2" permid="rCu">
      <caption>Two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> that satisfy L'Hôpital's Rule.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/2_8_LHR2" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="zgT">
      it is important to remember that the justification of the rule is graphical:
      the main idea is that the slopes of the tangent lines to <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> at <m>x = a</m> determine the value of the limit of <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> as <m>x \to a</m>.
      We see this in <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR2">Figure</xref>,
      where we can see from the grid that
      <m>f'(a) = 2</m> and <m>g'(a) = -1</m>,
      hence by L'Hôpital's Rule,
      <me permid="TJE">
        \lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} = \frac{2}{-1} = -2
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="foc">
      It's not the fact that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> both approach zero that matters most,
      but rather the <em>rate</em>
      at which each approaches zero that determines the value of the limit.
      This is a good way to remember what L'Hôpital's Rule says:
      if <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>,
      the the limit of <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> as <m>x \to a</m> is given by the ratio of the slopes of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> at <m>x = a</m>.

    <title>Limits involving <m>\infty</m></title>
    <p permid="XJD">
      The concept of infinity,
          <idx><h>infinity</h></idx>
      denoted <m>\infty</m>, arises naturally in calculus,
      as it does in much of mathematics.
      It is important to note from the outset that <m>\infty</m> is a concept,
      but not a number itself.
      Indeed, the notion of <m>\infty</m> naturally invokes the idea of limits.
      Consider, for example, the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>,
      whose graph is pictured in <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p permid="DQM">
      We note that <m>x = 0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      so we may naturally wonder what happens as <m>x \to 0</m>.
      As <m>x \to 0^+</m>, we observe that <m>f(x)</m>
      <em>increases without bound</em>.
      That is, we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> closer and closer
      (but not equal)
      to 0, while keeping <m>x \gt 0</m>.
      This is a good way to think about what infinity represents:
      a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.
    </p>

    <p permid="jXV">
      Recall that the statement <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</m>,
      means that can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>.
      We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either <m>L</m> or <m>a</m> can be <m>\infty</m>.
      For instance, for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we now write
      <me permid="zQN">
        \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty
      </me>,
      by which we mean that we can make
      <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to 0.
      In a similar way, we write
      <me permid="fXW">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
      </me>,
      since we can make <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as close to 0 as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large (i.e., by letting <m>x</m> increase without bound).
    </p>

    <p permid="Qfe">
      In general, the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty</m> means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>, and the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L</m>  means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      This notation also applies to left- and right-hand limits,
      and to limits involving <m>-\infty</m>.
      For example, returning to <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>
      and <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we can say that
      <me permid="Mff">

    <p permid="wmn">
      Finally, we write
      <me permid="smo">

      For the exponential decay function <m>e^{-x}</m>,
      these limits are reversed,
      with <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-x} = 0</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} e^{-x} = \infty</m>.
      Turning to the natural logarithm function,
      we have <m>\lim_{x \to 0^+} \ln(x) = -\infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \ln(x) = \infty</m>.
      While both <m>e^x</m> and <m>\ln(x)</m> grow without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>,

      To evaluate the limit of a quotient of two functions
      <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> that results in an indeterminate form of <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>,
      in essence we are asking which function is growing faster without bound.
      We say that the function <m>g</m> <em>dominates</em>
      the function <m>f</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m> provided that
      <me permid="BGa">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0
      </me>,
      whereas <m>f</m> dominates <m>g</m> provided that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \infty</m>.
      Finally, if the value of <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> is finite and nonzero,
      we say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
      <em>grow at the same rate</em>.
      For example,
      we saw that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0</m>,
      so <m>e^x</m> dominates <m>x^2</m>,
      while <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10} = \frac{3}{7}</m>,
      so <m>f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5</m> and
      <m>g(x) = 7x^2 + 9x - 10</m> grow at the same rate.

            Derivatives can be used to help us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form
