# quickstart instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Clone [MathBook XML](https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook) and install its dependencies.
3. Copy `Makefile.paths.original` to `Makefile.paths`. Edit `Makefile.paths` as instructed within that file.
4. Execute `make acs-extraction`
5. Then execute `make html`, `make pdf`, or other things detailed in `Makefile`. Output will be produced in the `output` folder.
