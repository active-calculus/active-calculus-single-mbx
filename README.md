# active-calculus-single-mbx
Repository for Active Calculus (single variable)

If you just want to read the book, *Active Calculus* is available from [activecalculus.org](https://activecalculus.org/). If you need to build it for yourself or make edits to the source code, then this is the repository for you.

# quickstart instructions
1. Ensure you have version 1.7.0 or higher of the PreTeXt CLI installed. With the upgrade to 1.7.0, there is no longer a need to first build WeBWorK representations.
1. If building for Runestone Interactive, `pretext build runestone` will suffice.
1. If building for HTML, `pretext build html` is what you need.
